or etymological propriety of language, nor even in its popular use, as in the subject or in the occasion on which they are used, and the object to be attained (Maxwells Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Edition, page 52)In order, therefore, to come to a decision as to the true meaning of a word used in a Statute one has to enquire as to the subject-matter of the enactment and the object which the Legislature had in viewThis leads us to a consideration of some of the relevant sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure and other enactments having a material bearing on the question before us4Section 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which is in Chapter XXVI headed Of the Judgment requires that the judgment in every trial in any criminal court of original jurisdiction shall be pronounced in open court and in the language of the courtSection 367 requires every such judgment to be written by the presiding officer (or from his dictationtion ) in the language of the court or in English, containing the point or points for determination, the decision thereon and the reasons for the decisionThe judgement has to be dated land signed by the presiding officer in open courtExcept

as may be after the delivery of the judgment be given to him free of cost without any applicationThis, however, is without prejudice to his right to obtain free of cost on an application made by him, a copy of the judgment or order and in trials by jury a copy of the heads of charge to the jury(4) without his asking for the same is presumably to enable him to decide for himself whether he would

of limitationThat purpose becomes clear when we pass on to s419, to peruse the same and after perusing the same to do one of the two things, namely, if it finds that there is no sufficient ground for interfering, to dismiss the appeal summarily or when the court does not dismiss the appeal summarily, then under s417, as in the present case, to cause a like notice to be given to the accusedThe act

the assessment year 1949-50 at Rs36,281The correctness of these orders is not in question before usWe are concerned in these proceedings with the vires of an order, which the Income-tax Officer made on October 9, 1950, under s28 read with ssIt will be convenient to set out these provisions, so far as they are material for the purpose of this appealSection 18A(3) provides that :  Any person who has not hitherto been assessed shall, before the 15th day of March in each financial year, if his total income of the period which would be the previous year for an assessment for the financial year next following is likely to exceed six thousand rupees, send to the Income-tax Officer an estimate of the tax payable by him on that part of his income to which the provisions of s18 do not apply of

referred to in clause (b), to have failed to furnish the return of his total income; and the provisions of section 28, so far as may be, shall apply accordingly:3Then, there is a proviso which imposes a limit on the amount of penalty, which can be levied(1) or subs22 or subs(2) of section 23, or (c) has concealed the particulars of his income or deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars of such

Income-tax Officer preferred an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal, which disagreed with the view of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner that the respondent was no longer a new assessee within

{"File_Name": "1958_S_47.txt", "Summary200": "Sri Baru Ram v SmtPrasanni and Others Supreme Court of India  30 September 1958 Civil Appeal NoP  409  of 1958The Judgment was delivered by : P B Gajendragadkar, J 1The appellant Shri Baru Ram was elected to the Punjab Legislative Assembly from the Rajaund constituency in the Karnal DistrictThat left three candidates in the fieldThey were the appellant Baru Ram, Mrs Prasanni and Harkesh, respondents 1 and 2 respectivelyThe polling took place on March 14, 1957, and the result was declared the next daySince the appellant had secured the largest number of votes he was declared duly electedSoon thereafter Mrs Prasanni, respondent 1, filed an election petition in which she alleged that the appellant had committed several corrupt practices and claimed a declaration that his election was voidThe election tribunal first framed six preliminary issues and after they were decided, it -raised twenty-nine issues on the meritsThis point was upheld2123(7)(c)That is why the order passed by the tribunal declaring the appellants election to be void was confirmed though on a different ground3At the hearing of the appeal Mr Doabia raised a preliminary objectionThe judgment under appeal was delivered on May 13, 1958, and the petition for leave to appeal under Art136 of the Constitution has been filed in this Court on September 2, 1958It is common ground that the appellant had appliedfor leave to the Punjab High Court on June 9, 1958,and his application was dismissed on August 22, 1958133 of the Constitution was incompetent; the time taken in the disposal of the said application cannot therefore be taken into account in computing the period of limitation116A (2) of the Representation of the People Act (43 of 1951) (hereinafter called the Act) specifically provides that the High Court, in hearing an appeal presented to it shall have the same powers, jurisdiction and authority and follow the same procedure with respect to the said appeal as if it were an appeal from an original decree passed by a civil court situated within the local limits of its civil appellate jurisdictionWe do not propose to deal with the merits of these contentions116A of the Act generally apply for leave under Art133 and in fact such applications are entertained and considered on the merits by themIt is true that Mr Doabias argument is that this practice is erroneous and that ArtAssuming that Mr Doabia is right, it is clear that the appellant has merely followed the general practice in this matter when he applied for leave to the Punjab High Court; his application was entertained, considered on the merits and rejected by the High CourtUnder these circumstances we think that even if we were to hold that Art133 has no application, we would unhesitatingly have excused the delay made in the presentation of the appeal; and so we do not think we can throw out the appeal in limine on the ground of limitation4123(7)(c) is not supported by any evidence2(c) of the Act means any of the practices specified in s123Section 123(7)(c) provides inter alia that the obtaining or procuring or abetting or attempting to obtain or procure by a candidate any assistance other than giving of vote for the furtherance of the prospects of that candidates election from any person in the service of the Government and who is a member of the armed forces of the Union, is a corrupt practiceIt was alleged that Puran Singh actively canvassed for the appellant on March 11th to 13th, 1957, in his village and so much so that he subsequently served as his polling agent at polling booth No15 at village Kotra on March 14, 1957It would thus be seen that the point which falls for our decision in the present appeal lies within a very narrow compassGoing back to s123, explanation (2) to the said section provides that for the purpose of cl123(7)(c)But it is important to bear in mind that before such a conclusion is drawn the provisions of s46 of the Act must be taken into account25 or at the place fixed under subs29 for the poll4615 at Kotra123(7)(c) ?This position is not disputedW 48/1)The High Court thought that the identity of this glaring mistake in both the forms coupled with the similarity of the handwriting of the rest of the writing in them showed that the two forms must have been written by the same scribeIt would, however, be relevant to add that it is not at all clear from the record that the same scribe may not have written similar forms for other candidates as wellThere is no evidence to show that the scribe who made this glaring mistake had been employed as his own scribe by the appellant5Respondent 1 had examined herself in support of this plea and Banwari Lal whom she examined supported her in that behalfThe tribunal was not impressed by the evidence of these two witnesses; and it has given reasons for not accepting their evidence as true or reliableIt is unnecessary to emphasize that, in dealing with an appeal under s116A of the Act, High Courts should normally attach importance to the findings of fact recorded by the tribunal when the said findings rest solely on the appreciation of oral evidenceIn this connection, we would like to add that it is difficult to understand why the High Court did not accept the criticism made by the tribunal against these two witnessesIn his cross- examination, Jangi Ram stated that Jagtu and Pal Chand were the agents of Shri Baru Ram, but he added that Puran Singh was not at the polling boothJhandu, another witness examined by the appellant has stated so on oath and his statement has not been challenged in cross-examination6Puran Singh was examined by respondent 1; but when he gave evidence, he was allowed to be treated as hostile and cross-examined by her counselIt, however, appears that Chand Jamadar to whose platoon Puran Singh is attached gave evidence that the signature of Puran Singh on the form in question (PW 48/1) appeared to be like the signatures on acquittance rolls which had been admittedly made by himOn the same question hand writing experts were examined by both the partiesOn the other hand, Mr Kapur whom the appellant examined gave a contrary opinion7It is the correctness of this finding which is seriously disputed by Mr Aggarwal before us123 (7)(c) of the ActUnder these circumstances, it was clearly necessary for respondent I to examine competent witnesses to prove the appellants signature on the formIt appears that after the whole of the evidence was recorded, respondent woke up to this infirmity in her case and applied to the tribunal for permission to examine an expert in that behalfThis application was made on February 6, 1958; and the only explanation given for the delay in making it was that it was after the appellant denied his signature on oath that respondent I realized the need for examining an expert8In our opinion this contention is wholly untenableIt must be borne in mind that the allegation against the appellant is that he has committed a corrupt practice and a finding against him on the point would involve serious consequencesMr Doabia argues that it is not always absolutely necessary to examine an expert or to lead other evidence to prove handwritingIt would be possible and legal, he contends, to prove the handwriting of a person from circumstantial evidenceSections 45 and 47 of the said Act (I of 1872), prescribe the method in which such signature can be proved45, the opinion of the handwriting experts is relevant while under s47 the opinion of any person acquainted with the handwriting of the person who is alleged to have signed the document is admissibleThe explanation to the section explains when a person can be said to be acquainted with the handwriting of another personThus, there can be no doubt as to the manner in which the alleged signature of the appellant could and should have been proved; but even assuming that the signature of the appellant can be legally held to be proved on circumstantial evidence the principle which governs the appreciation of such circumstantial evidence in cases of this kind cannot be ignored123(7)(c) of the Act9In support of his objection, Mr Aggarwal has referred us to the decision of this Court in Vashist Narain Sharma vDev Chandra, [1955] 1 SCR 509 1954 Indlaw SC 43In this case, when the respondent, having failed on the finding recorded by the tribunal in his favour, attempted to argue that he could support the decision of the tribunal on other grounds which had been found against him, this Court hold that he was not entitled to do soThe provision of the Code of Civil Procedure which permits the respondent to adopt such a course, it was observed, has no application to an appeal filed by special leave under Art136We have no appeal before us on behalf of the respondent, observed Ghulam Hasan J and we are unable to allow that question to be reagitatedMr Doabia challenges the correctness of these observations116A of the Act which empowers the High Court to exercise its jurisdiction, authority and power, and to follow the same procedure, as would apply to appeals preferred against original decrees passed by a civil court within the local limits of its civil appellate jurisdictionThere is no doubt that, in an ordinary civil appeal, the respondent would be entitled to support the decree under appeal on grounds other than those found by the trial court in his favourOrder 41, rule 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which permits the respondent to file crossobjections recognize the respondents right to support the decree on any of the grounds decided against him by the court belowPrima facie there appears to be some force in this contention; but we do not think it necessary to decide this point in the present appealWe may add that the two points of law raised by the respective objections of both the parties may have to be considered by a larger Bench on a suitable occasionThe facts on which this contention is raised are no longer in disputeMr Jai Bhagawan who presented his nomination paper to the returning officer on January 29, 1956, was admittedly not an elector in the constituency of Rajaund in the District of KarnalIt is alleged that he was a voter in another constituencyWhen the returning officer noticed that the candidate had not produced the relevant document, he gave him, at his request, two hours time to produce it36 (2)(b) of the ActIt is true that the candidate subsequently purported to produce before the officer his affidavit that his name was entered as a voter in the list of voters (No1074, Constituency No6, Karnal Baneket No21, Vol36(2)(b)36(2)(b)(4) and (5) of this sectionThe proviso to this sub-section requires the returning officer to permit clerical or technical errors to be correctedHowever, his failure to do so does not entail any penalty33 deals with the stage of the scrutiny of the nomination papers and it provides that where a candidate is an elector of a different constituency, a copy of the electoral roll of that constituency or the relevant part thereof or a certified copy of the relevant entry of such roll shall, unless it is filed along with the nomination paper, be produced before the returning officer at the time of the scrutinyIt is thus clear that when the stage of scrutiny is reached the returning officer has to be satisfied that the candidate is an elector of a different constituency and for that purpose the statute has provided the mode of proof Section 36, sub-s(8) is to prepare a list of validly nominated candidates, that is to say, candidates whose nominations have been found valid and to affix it to the notice board of the returning officerSub-section (2) then deals with the scrutiny of the nomination papers and provides that the returning officer shall decide all objections which may be made to any nomination and may either on such objection, or on his own motion, after such summary -enquiry, if any, as he thinks necessary, reject any nomination on any of the grounds mentioned in cls(a), (b) and (c) of the said sub-sectionIt is obvious that this enquiry must be summary and cannot be elaborate or prolongedIn fact, sub-s(5) directs that the returning officer shall not allow any adjournment of the proceedings except when such proceedings are interrupted or obstructed by riots, by open violence or by causes beyond hip, control and the proviso to this sub-section adds that in case an objection is made the candidate concerned may be allowed time to rebut it not later than the next day but one following the date fixed for scrutiny, and the returning officer shall record his decision on the date to which the proceedings have been adjourned3433(5) and prima facie sIt is, however, urged that the statute itself makes a distinction between defects which are of a substantial character and those which are not of a substantial characterThe failure to produce the requisite copy, it is urged, may amount to a defect but it is not a defect of a substantial characterWe are not impressed by this argument36(2)(b) must inevitably followIt is well-settled that the statutory requirements of election law have to be strictly observedAs observed by Mahajan C J who delivered the judgment of this Court in Jagan Nath vJagwant Singh, [1954] SC R 892 1954 Indlaw SC 19 an election contest is not an action at law or a suit in equity but is a purely statutory proceeding unknown to the common law and that the court possesses no common law power The learned Chief Justice has also added that it is a sound principle of natural justice that the success of a candidate who has won at an election should not be lightly interfered with and any petition seeking such interference must strictly conform to the requirements of the lawIn this connection we may usefully refer to another decision of this Court in Rattan Anmol Singh vAtma Ram, [1955] 1 SCR 481 1954 Indlaw SC 44While dealing with the question as to whether the requirements as to attestation were of a technical or of an unsubstantial character, Bose J observed that when the law enjoins the obser vance of a particular formality, it cannot be disregarded and the substance of the thing must be there10This approach, it is said, is inconsistent with the decision of this Court in Pratap Singh vShri Krishna Gupta, AIR 1956 SC 140 1952 Indlaw SC 119(1)(i) rendered his nomination paper invalid and it was answered by the court in the

appellant, the Commissioner of Income-tax, Assam34SmtThe said estate has vast areas of forest tracts, considerable portions of which are covered mainly by sal trees567Birendra Narayana Chowdhury, the respondent in CA No58 of 1956, was a co-sharer proprietor of the same estate89101112(1) Smt1314From all that was done to the trees it was clear that the trees sold were those standing for a considerable number of years during which the soil had remained untouchedIn the production of the income the applicants made no contribution by way of cultivationThe applicants case, however, was that there had been employment of human skill and labour with respect to the forestsApart from the fact of the maintenance of a forest establishment, it was claimed that human skill and labour were employed for the maintenance, preservation, nursing, improving and rearing of the forests, so that the quality and general condition of the forest might be improvedIn order to establish these facts an affidavit was filed before the Tribunal at the time of hearing of the appealBut the actual costs with reference to each activity could not be found from the books of the assesseeIt is not disputed that no sum was contributed towards cultivation15We shall however proceed on the basis that these facts were proved by the assessees and determine whether the operations which the assessees claim to have performed in these forests were agricultural operations such as to bring the income derived from these forests within the definition of agricultural income1615,000 a year, the gross receipts being about Rs1, 70, 0003,32,414, the appellants representative stated that a total sum of Rs14, 057 had been spent on the following head: 8 Forest Officers and 18 Barkandajas Rs5,219 32 Forest Guards Rs4,838 Proportionate salary of the Head Officers Rs4,000 Total Rs14,057 17In the opinion of the Court those operations were agricultural operations and the land on which the trees stood was being used for agricultural purposes and, therefore, the income from the sale of the trees was agricultural income and was exempt from taxation u/s18The appellant applied for and obtained certificated of fitness under section 66A(2) of the Act and that is how these appeals have come up for hearing and final disposal before us19The connotation of the terms agriculture and agricultural purpose and the conditions under which the forestry operations performed by the assessee on forests of spontaneous growth can be assimilated to agricultural operations so as to constitute the income derived from the sale of the forest trees agricultural income within the meaning of its definition in sRaja Benoy Kumar Sahas RoyApplying the principles which we have enunciated in that judgment to the facts of the instant cases, it appears that there was no planting or sowing of the seeds nor was any human agency employed for the purpose of tilling the soilThe soil had remained untouched and in the production of the income the assessees had made no contribution by way of cultivation20There were no basic operations either which were performed by the assessees on the forest landsWhat was done by them was the performance of forestry operations which were in the nature of subsequent operations, operations which were performed after the produce had sprouted form the soilThe forests continued to be forests of spontaneous growth and the only result of the performance of these operations on the produce of the forests which was the outcome of spontaneous growth unaided by human skill and labour was the maintenance, preservation, nursing, improving and rearing of the forestsEven though these subsequent operations had the effect of increasing the produce of the forests, the forests none the less

CA No58 of 1956, was a co-sharer proprietor of the same estate89101112(1) Smt1314From all that was done to the trees it was clear that the trees sold were those standing for a considerable number of years during which the soil had remained untouchedIn the production of the income the applicants made no contribution by way of cultivationThe applicants case, however, was that there had been employment of human skill and labour with respect to the forestsApart from the fact of the maintenance of a forest establishment, it was claimed that human skill and labour were employed for the maintenance, preservation, nursing, improving and rearing of the forests, so that the quality and general condition of the forest might be improvedIn order to establish these facts an affidavit was filed before the Tribunal at the time of hearing of the appealBut the actual costs with reference to each activity could not be found from the books of the assesseeIt is not disputed that no sum was contributed towards cultivation15We shall however proceed on the basis that these facts were proved by the assessees and determine whether the operations which the assessees claim to have performed in these forests were agricultural operations such as to bring the income derived from these forests within the definition of agricultural income1615,000 a year, the gross receipts being about Rs1, 70,

Proportionate salary of the Head Officers Rs4,000 Total Rs14,057 17In the opinion of the Court those operations were agricultural operations and the land on which the trees stood was being used for agricultural purposes and, therefore, the income from the sale of the trees was agricultural income and was exempt from taxation u/s18The appellant applied for and obtained certificated of fitness under section 66A(2) of the Act and that is how these appeals have come up for hearing and final disposal before us19The connotation of the terms agriculture and agricultural purpose and the conditions under which the forestry operations performed by the assessee on forests of spontaneous growth can be assimilated to agricultural operations so as to constitute the income derived from the sale of the forest trees agricultural income within the meaning of its definition in sRaja Benoy Kumar Sahas RoyApplying the principles which we have enunciated in that judgment to the facts of the instant cases, it appears that there was no planting or sowing of the seeds nor was any human agency employed for the purpose of tilling the soilThe soil had remained untouched and in the production of the income the assessees had made no contribution by way of cultivation20There were no basic operations either which were performed by the assessees on the forest landsWhat was done by them was the performance of forestry operations which were in the nature of subsequent operations, operations which were performed after the produce had sprouted form the soilThe forests continued to be forests of spontaneous growth and the only result of the performance of these operations on the produce of the forests which was the outcome of spontaneous growth unaided by human skill and labour was the maintenance, preservation, nursing, improving and rearing of the forestsEven though these subsequent operations had the effect of increasing the produce of the forests, the forests none the less remained forests of spontaneous growth21The various operations which were described in the statements of case were no doubt for fostering the growth of the forests and obtain the greatest advantage

No57 of 1953The Divisional Bench (Chakravarti, C J, and Lahiri, J) in the judgment under appeal merely followed their earlier judgment delivered the same day in Income-tax Reference No22 of 1953, since reported as Hindustan Investment Corporation vCommissioner of Income-tax ([1955] 27 ITR 202 1954 Indlaw CAL 16)It is the latter judgment which gives the reasons for the decision2The facts of the case have been stated with sufficient fulness, yet briefly, in the statement of the case submitted by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (Calcutta Bench) and may be conveniently set out in its own words: The applicant had received sums of Rs3,831, Rs6,606, Rs7,954 and Rs8,304 in the four assessment years, 194445, 1945-46, 1946-47 and 1947-48 as income from dividends18(5)The Tribunal, however, on being moved, referred the following question to the High Court: Whether in the facts and circumstances of this case, the Applicant (the assessee) was entitled to have this dividend income grossed up u/sThe High Court answered the question in the negative, thus affirming the decisions of the Department and the Appellate Tribunal4The relevant sections are as follows: 16(2) : For the purposes of inclusion in the total income of an assessee any dividend shall be deemed to be income of the previous year in which it is paid, credited or distributed or deemed to have been paid, credited or distributed to him, and shall be increased to such amount as would, if income-tax (but not super-tax) at the rate applicable to the total income of the company without taking into account any rebate allowed or additional income-tax charged for the financial year in which the dividend is paid, credited or distributed or deemed to have been paid, credited or distributed, were deducted therefrom, be equal to the amount of the dividend: (proviso omitted)20 in the assessment, if any, made for the following year under this Act: (proviso omitted)165In our opinion, the High Court was right in its conclusionIt is itself chargeable under the Act, In Cull vInland Revenue Commissioners ([1940] AC 51, 56 ; (1939) 22 Tax Cas603, 636), Lord Atkin stated the law (which in substance is also the law in our country) thus: 6This principle is explained in another English case, and it is substantially also the law in this countryBlott ([1921] 2 AC 171, 201), Viscount Cave stated the law in these words: Plainly, a company paying income-tax on its profits does not pay it as agent for its shareholdersIf a dividend is declared, -the company is entitled to deduct from such dividend a proportionate part of the amount of the tax previously paid by the company; and, in that case, the payment by the company operates in relief of the shareholderBut no agency, properly so called, is involved718(5) and 4 9B(1) to be payment by the shareholdersThe rates of income-tax applicable to the company are, in most instances, higher than the rates applicable to the individual shareholders, and by this process of grossing up, as it is commonly called, the recipient of the dividend gets some benefit8Of course, between the transferor and the transferee, certain equities arise even on the execution and handing over of a blank transfer, and among these equities is the right of the transferee to claim the dividend declared and paid to the transferor who is treated as a trustee on behalf of the transferee9Indeed, the opinion of most of the writers on the subject is also the same10- No rights arise till such registration ,takes place18, Table A is made applicable to companies, unless by the Articles of any company the terms of Table A have been excluded or modifiedMorgan (1888) 37 ChD 346, 356)The learned Lord Justices held that under s15 of that Act, the transferee bad not the benefit of a legal title till certain things were done, which were indicated by Lopes, LJ, in the following passage: Therefore the transferor, until the delivery of the deed of transfer to the secretary, is subject to all the liabilities and entitled to all the rights which belong to a shareholder or stockholder, and, in my opinion until the requisite formalities are complied with, he continues the legal -proprietor of the stock or shares subject to that proprietorship being divested, which it may be at any moment, by a compliance with the requisite formalities8See Nagabushanam vRamachandra Rao (1922)

the transferee with an equitable ownership-, are not sufficient to make the transferee a full owner, since the legal interest vis-a-vis the company still outstands in the transferor; so much so, that the company credits the dividends only to the transferor and also calls upon him to make payment of any unpaid capital, which may be neededHomersham ((1878-79) L R 4 ExD 24) or Wimbush, In re Richards vWimbush ([1940] 1 ChD 92456) hardly advance the matter further than this16(2)The Department, on the other hand, says that the dividend can be increased under se9They are all against the assesseeSee

Company, Limited v Commissioner of Income Tax, Calcutta Supreme Court of India  26 March 1959 Civil Appeal No65 of 1956 The Judgment was delivered by: M Hidayatullah, J 1Messrs66A(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act from the Calcutta High Court, to appeal to this Court against the judgment dated August 31, 1954, in Income-tax Reference No57 of 1953The Divisional Bench (Chakravarti, C J, and Lahiri, J) in the judgment under appeal merely followed their earlier judgment delivered the same day in Income-tax Reference No22 of 1953, since reported as Hindustan Investment Corporation vCommissioner of Income-tax ([1955] 27 ITR 202 1954 Indlaw CAL 16)It is the latter judgment which gives the reasons for the decision2The facts of the case have been stated with sufficient fulness, yet briefly, in the statement of the case submitted by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (Calcutta Bench) and may be conveniently set out in its own words: The applicant had received sums of Rs3,831, Rs6,606, Rs7,954 and Rs8,304 in the four assessment years, 194445, 1945-46, 1946-47 and 1947-48 as income from dividends18(5)The Tribunal, however, on being moved, referred the following question to the High Court: Whether in the facts and circumstances of this case, the Applicant (the assessee) was entitled to have this dividend income grossed up u/sThe High Court answered the question in the negative, thus affirming the decisions of the Department and the Appellate Tribunal4The relevant sections are as follows: 16(2) : For the purposes of inclusion in the total income of an assessee any dividend shall be deemed to be income of the previous year in which it is paid, credited or distributed or deemed to have been paid, credited or distributed to him, and shall be increased to such amount as would, if income-tax (but not super-tax) at the rate applicable to the total income of the company without taking into account any rebate allowed or additional income-tax charged for the financial year in which the dividend is paid, credited or distributed or deemed to have been paid, credited or distributed, were deducted therefrom, be equal to the amount of the dividend: (proviso omitted)20 in the assessment, if any, made for the following year under this Act: (proviso omitted)165In our opinion, the High Court was right in its conclusionIt is itself chargeable under the Act, In Cull vInland Revenue Commissioners ([1940] AC 51, 56  (1939) 22 Tax Cas603, 636), Lord Atkin stated the law (which in substance is also the law in our country) thus: 6This principle is explained in another English case, and it is substantially also the law in this countryBlott ([1921] 2 AC 171, 201), Viscount Cave stated the law in these words: Plainly, a company paying income-tax on its profits does not pay it as agent for its shareholdersIf a dividend is declared, -the company is entitled to deduct from such dividend a proportionate part of the amount of the tax previously paid by the company and, in that case, the payment by the company operates in relief of the shareholderBut no agency, properly so called, is involved718(5) and 4 9B(1) to be payment by the shareholdersThe rates of income-tax applicable to the company are, in most instances, higher than the rates applicable to the individual shareholders, and by this process of grossing up, as it is commonly called, the recipient of the dividend gets some benefit8Of course, between the transferor and the transferee, certain equities arise even on the execution and handing over of a blank transfer, and among these equities is the right of the transferee to claim the dividend declared and paid to the transferor who is treated as a trustee on behalf of the transferee9Indeed, the opinion of most of the writers on the subject is also the same10- No rights arise till such registration ,takes place18, Table A is made applicable to companies, unless by the Articles of any company the terms of Table A have been excluded or modifiedMorgan (1888) 37 ChD 346, 356)The learned Lord Justices held that under s15 of that Act, the transferee bad not the benefit of a legal title till certain things were done, which were indicated by Lopes, LJ, in the following passage: Therefore the transferor, until the delivery of the deed of transfer to the secretary, is subject to all the liabilities and entitled to all the rights which belong to a shareholder or stockholder, and, in my opinion until the requisite formalities are complied with, he continues the legal -proprietor of the stock or shares subject to that proprietorship being divested, which it may be at any moment, by a compliance with the requisite formalities8See Nagabushanam vRamachandra Rao (1922) ILR 45 Mad537)See E D Sassoon & Co Ltd vPatch-(1922) 45 BomLR 46) approved in Mathalone vBombay Life Assurance Co Ltd ([1954] SCR 117 1953 Indlaw SC 54)But these rights though they, no doubt, clothe the transferee with an equitable ownership-, are not sufficient to make the transferee a full owner, since the legal interest vis-a-vis the company still outstands in the transferor so much so, that the company credits the dividends only to the transferor and also calls upon him to make payment of any unpaid capital, which may be neededHomersham ((1878-79) L R 4 ExD 24) or Wimbush, In re Richards vWimbush ([1940] 1 ChD 92456) hardly advance the matter further than this16(2)The Department, on the other hand, says that the dividend can be increased under se9They are all against the assesseeSee Shree Shakti Mills Ltd vCommissioner of Income-tax ([1948] 16 ITR

Public Finance, Mr Findlay Shirras has pointed out that the classification of public revenue or income, both of the State and of municipalities, has undergone considerable change in recent years and

Judgment was delivered by : B Jagannadhadas, J 1There were various charges against him and Mr Justice Das Gupta was deputed by order of the Chief Justice dated the 28th May, 1651, to make an enquiry and submit a reportMr Justice Das Gupta made a full enquiry and submitted his report on the 11th August, 1951, in which he exonerated the appellant in respect of some of the charges but found him guilty in respect of the other chargesThe learned Judge expressed his conclusion as follows: Mr Bose (the appellant) must be held to be guilty of misconduct and dishonest conduct and (that) he is unfit to hold the office of Registrar of the Original Side of this Court2The Chief Justice issued to the appellant a notice on the 16th August, 1951, intimating that be agreed with the report after careful consideration thereof and asking him to show cause why he should Not be dismissed from his postSri P K Bose was represented by eminent Counsel and every opportunity was given to him to meet the charges and put forward his explanation and defenceThe learned Judge however in a full and very carefully considered report found Sri P K Bose guilty of serious charges involving moral turpitude and dishonesty and further he was of opinion that Sri P K Bose was by reason thereof unfit to hold the said office of RegistrarI considered this report and the evidence most anxiously and found myself in entire agreement with the learned JudgeSri P K Bose was, in my view, clearly guilty of the matter comprised in the charges specified by Mr Justice K C Das GuptaI considered that prima facie the conduct of Sri P K Bose warranted dismissal and I therefore gave him notice under article 311(2) of the Constitution of India to show cause against the action proposed against him, namely, dismissalOn the 31st august, 1951, Sri PK Bose showed cause before me and I heard Sri Sachin Chaudhuri his counsel and Sri P K Bose personallyIn all the circumstances this is not a case in which I can properly show any leniencySri P K Bose has abused the trust and confidence reposed in him and has been found guilty of serious malpractices and dishonestyConduct such as this of an officer of the status of the Registrar of the Original Side of this Court is unpardonable and must be dealt with severelyLet a copy of this order be served on Sri P K Bose3On the 25th January, 1952, the appellant submitted a petition to the Governor of West Bengal for cancellation of the above orderHe received intimation dated the 9th July, 1952, that the Governor declines to interfere on his behalfIt may be mentioned that it was Chief Justice, Sir Arthur Trevor Harries, who had initiated the proceedings against the appellant and passed the order of dismissalHe retired in June, 1952The application for review was made to the successor Chief Justice, Shri P B Chakravarti, on the 11th September, 1952This application was rejected on the 16th September, 1952Thereafter on the 24th November, 1952, ieThis order was duly served and on its return the learned Judge made an order referring the hearing of the application to a Special Bench of three Judges as per the rules of the CourtLeave to appeal to this Court was, however, granted by them under article 132(1) on the ground that the case involves substantial questions of law relating to interpretation of theConstitution4On behalf of the respondent, ieIn addition to controverting the correctness of the above contentions raised on behalf of the appellant, he strongly urged that (1) no writ could issue from the High Court against its own Chief Justice; (2) the order of the Chief Justice, the validity of which is being challenged, is a purely administrative order against which no application for writ is maintainable; and (3) this was not a case in which having regard to all the circumstances, any application by way of a writ should have been entertained56But it is strongly urged that he had not the power to dismiss7I the argument recognises the fact that dismissal is a matter which falls within conditions of service of a public servant as held by the Privy Council in Northwest Frontier Province vSuraj Narain Anand, [1948] LR 75 IA 8438These rules were framed on the 19th June, 1930, and published on the 21st June, 1930Clause 8 of the Letters Patent of 1865 as amended in 1919, which continues to be operative, as also clause 4 thereof, are relevant for the present purposeThey are as follows: 8And it is Our further will and pleasure and We do hereby for Us, Our heirs and successors give grant, direct, and appoint, that all and every the officers and clerks to be appointed as aforesaid shall have and receive respectively such reasonable salaries as the Chief Justice shall, from time to time, appoint for each office and place respectively, and as the Governor General in Council shall approve ofProvided always, and it is Our will and pleasure, that all and every the officers and clerks to be appointed as aforesaid shall be resident within the limits of the jurisdiction of the said Court, so long as they shall hold their respective offices; but this proviso shall not interfere with or prejudice the right of any officer or clerk to avail himself of leave of absence under any rules prescribed by the Governor General in Council, and to absent himself from the said limits during the term of such leave, in accordance with the said rules4We do hereby appoint and ordain, that every clerk and ministerial officer of the said High Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal, appointed by virtue of the said Letters Patent of the Fourteenth of May, One thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, shall continue to hold and enjoy his office and employment, with the salary thereunto annexed, until he be removed from such office and employment; and he shall be subject to the like power of removal, regulations, and provisions if he were appointed by virtue of these Letters Patent9But it is obvious from the last portion of clause 4 that such power was taken to be implicit under clause 8 and presumably as arising from the power of appointment10The power of removal or of taking other disciplinary action as regards such appointees was not in terms grantedBut there is historical evidence to show that the power of appointment conferred under the Charter was always understood as comprising the above powersSir Charles Wood, the then Secretary of State for India in paragraph 10 of his dispatch to the Governor General dated the 17th May, 1862, (on the formation of the new High Courts) stated as follows: The Supreme Court exercises an authority entirely independent of the Government in respect of its ministerial officers11It is this power and authority along with other judicial power and authority that was succeeded to by the High Courts (on their formation in supersession of the Supreme and Sadar Courts) by virtue of section 9 of the Indian High Courts Act, in the following terms1213All the powers under the Letters Patent were, however, subject to alteration by competent legislative authority by virtue of clause 44 of the Letters Patent1415They are as follows: 2291617Such continuance, therefore, can only operate by a process of adaptation implicitly Authorised by the very terms of section 276That rule shows that the Governor General in Council or Local Government of a Governors Province may impose any of the penalties specified in rule 49 (which includes dismissal) on any person included in any of the classes I to 5 specified in rule 14 who is serving under the administrative control of the Governor-general in Council or the Local Government, as the case may beThis rule, if it originally applied to the High Court staff, must after 1935 be read by substituting Chief Justice in the place of the Local Government wherever it occurs therein and making other consequential alterationsThis would be so even apart from the normal implication of the power of appointment specifically recognised under the Act18It must be mentioned, at this stage, that so far as the power of dismissal is concerned, the position under theConstitution of 1950 is not open to any argument or doubtThis results from section 16 of the General Clauses Act which by virtue of article 367(1) of theConstitution applies to the construction of the word appointment in article 229(1)1920The further subordinate objections that have been raised remain to be consideredThis contention proceeds on a misapprehension of the nature of the powerAs pointed out in Barnard vNational Dock Labour Board, [1953] 2 QB 18, 40at page 40, it is true that no judicial tribunal can delegate its functions unless it is enabled to do so expressly or by necessary implicationIt is nonetheless so, by reason of the fact that an opportunity to show cause and an enquiry simulating judicial standards have to precede the exercise thereof It is well recognised that a statutory functionary exercising such a power cannot be said to have delegated his functions merely by deputing a responsible and competent official to enquire and report21That is the ordinary mode of exercise of any administrative powerWhat cannot be delegated except where the law specifically so providesis the ultimate responsibility for the exercise of such powerAs pointed out by the House of Lords in Board of Education vRice, [1911] AC 179, 182, a functionary who has to decide an administrative matter, of the nature involved in this case, can obtain the material on which he is to act in such manner as may be feasible and convenient, provided only the affected party has a fair opportunity to correct or contradict any relevant and prejudicial materialThe following passage from the speech of Lord Chancellor in Local Government Board V Arlidge , [1915] AC 120,133is apposite and in structiveMy Lords, I concur in this view of the position of an administrative body to which the decision of a question in dispute between parties has been entrustedThe result of its enquiry must, as I have said, be taken, in the absence of directions in the statute to the contrary, to be intended to be reached by its ordinary procedureIn the case of the Local Government Board it is not doubtful what this procedure isThe Minister at the head of the Board is directly responsible to Parliament like other MinistersHe is responsible not only for what he himself does but for all that is done in his departmentThe volume of work entrusted to him is very great and he cannot do the great bulk of it himselfHe is expected to obtain his materials vicariously through his officials, and he has discharged his duty if he sees that they obtain these materials for him properlyTo try to extend his duty beyond this and to insist that he and other members of the Board should do everything personally would be to impair his efficiencyUnlike a Judge in a Court he is not only at liberty but is compelled to rely on the assistance of his staff22In view of the above clear statement of the law the objection to the validity of the dismissal on the ground that the delegation of the enquiry amounts to the delegation of the power itself is without any substance and must be rejected2324The phrase all disciplinary matters affecting a person is sufficiently comprehensive to include any kind of disciplinary action proposed to be taken in respect of a particular personThis reasoning is not without forceUndoubtedly there is much to be said for the view that article 320(3) taken as a whole is inconsistent with article 229But it is possible to treat the requirement of prior consultation under article 320(3) (c) which relates to disciplinary action against individual Government employees and which is in the nature of an important constitutional safeguard for individual government employees as standing on a somewhat different footing from that under article 320(3) (a) or (b), which relate to general matters relating to recruitments, appointments, etc25Under article 311 the two constitutional safeguards, vizA close scrutiny of the terminology so used shows a marked departure in the language of article 320 (3) (c) from that in articles 310 and 31126The salaries of these persons are paid out of the State funds as appears from article 229(3) which provides that the administrative expenses of a High Court including all salaries, allowances and pensions payable to or in respect of officers and servants of the High Court, are chargeable upon the Consolidated Fund of a StateThe item relating to such administrative expenses has to form part of the annual financial statement to be presented to the State Legislative Assembly under article 202 and estimates thereof can form the subject matter of the discussion in the Legislature under article 203(1)The use of different terminology in the various articles was not likely to have been accidentalIt is to be noticed that even article 320 in its various clauses uses different phrasesIt appears, therefore, not unlikely that in using somewhat different phraseology, the intention was to demarcate the staff of the High Courts from the other civil services of the Union or the StateA close comparison of the terminology used in the corresponding provisions of the Government of India Act of 1935 also seems to confirm this demarcationA perusal of the main paragraph of subsection (3) of section 266 clearly shows that it has reference to three cate gories of services (1) Secretary of States services, (2) Federal services under the GovernorGeneral, and (3) Provincial Services under the GovernorIn the context of this section, the comprehensive phrase serving His Majesty seems to have been used as comprising only the above three services and should be exclusive of the staff of the High CourtThis may well have been intended not to apply to the High CourtsWe accordingly hold that the appellant was not entitled to the protection under article 320(3)(c)It follows that none of the three contentions raised on behalf of the appellant, ieThis application must accordingly fail on the merits27This would be enough to dispose of the case against the appellantArguments in this behalf have also been strongly urged before us by the learned Advocate General of West BengalIn the view, however, that we have taken as to the contentions raised before us regarding the validity of the order of dismissal, we do not feel called upon to enter into the discussion relating to the availability of the writ", "Summary1000": "Pradyat Kumar Bose v HonBle The Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court Supreme Court of India  23 December 1955 Civil Appeals Nos245 and 202 of 1953 The Judgment was delivered by : B Jagannadhadas, J 1There were various charges against him and Mr Justice Das Gupta was deputed by order of the Chief Justice dated the 28th May, 1651, to make an enquiry and submit a reportMr Justice Das Gupta made a full enquiry and submitted his report on the 11th August, 1951, in which he exonerated the appellant in respect of some of the charges but found him guilty in respect of the other chargesThe learned Judge expressed his conclusion as follows: Mr Bose (the appellant) must be held to be guilty of misconduct and dishonest conduct and (that) he is unfit to hold the office of Registrar of the Original Side of this Court2The Chief Justice issued to the appellant a notice on the 16th August, 1951, intimating that be agreed with the report after careful consideration thereof and asking him to show cause why he should Not be dismissed from his postSri P K Bose was represented by eminent Counsel and every opportunity was given to him to meet the charges and put forward his explanation and defenceThe learned Judge however in a full and very carefully considered report found Sri P K Bose guilty of serious charges involving moral turpitude and dishonesty and further he was of opinion that Sri P K Bose was by reason thereof unfit to hold the said office of RegistrarI considered this report and the evidence most anxiously and found myself in entire agreement with the learned JudgeSri P K Bose was, in my view, clearly guilty of the matter comprised in the charges specified by Mr Justice K C Das GuptaI considered that prima facie the conduct of Sri P K Bose warranted dismissal and I therefore gave him notice under article 311(2) of the Constitution of India to show cause against the action proposed against him, namely, dismissalOn the 31st august, 1951, Sri PK Bose showed cause before me and I heard Sri Sachin Chaudhuri his counsel and Sri P K Bose personallyIn all the circumstances this is not a case in which I can properly show any leniencySri P K Bose has abused the trust and confidence reposed in him and has been found guilty of serious malpractices and dishonestyConduct such as this of an officer of the status of the Registrar of the Original Side of this Court is unpardonable and must be dealt with severelyLet a copy of this order be served on Sri P K Bose3On the 25th January, 1952, the appellant submitted a petition to the Governor of West Bengal for cancellation of the above orderHe received intimation dated the 9th July, 1952, that the Governor declines to interfere on his behalfIt may be mentioned that it was Chief Justice, Sir Arthur Trevor Harries, who had initiated the proceedings against the appellant and passed the order of dismissalHe retired in June, 1952The application for review was made to the successor Chief Justice, Shri P B Chakravarti, on the 11th September, 1952This application was rejected on the 16th September, 1952Thereafter on the 24th November, 1952, ieThis order was duly served and on its return the learned Judge made an order referring the hearing of the application to a Special Bench of three Judges as per the rules of the CourtLeave to appeal to this Court was, however, granted by them under article 132(1) on the ground that the case involves substantial questions of law relating to interpretation of theConstitution4On behalf of the respondent, ieIn addition to controverting the correctness of the above contentions raised on behalf of the appellant, he strongly urged that (1) no writ could issue from the High Court against its own Chief Justice (2) the order of the Chief Justice, the validity of which is being challenged, is a purely administrative order against which no application for writ is maintainable and (3) this was not a case in which having regard to all the circumstances, any application by way of a writ should have been entertained56But it is strongly urged that he had not the power to dismiss7I the argument recognises the fact that dismissal is a matter which falls within conditions of service of a public servant as held by the Privy Council in Northwest Frontier Province vSuraj Narain Anand, [1948] LR 75 IA 8438These rules were framed on the 19th June, 1930, and published on the 21st June, 1930Clause 8 of the Letters Patent of 1865 as amended in 1919, which continues to be operative, as also clause 4 thereof, are relevant for the present purposeThey are as follows: 8And it is Our further will and pleasure and We do hereby for Us, Our heirs and successors give grant, direct, and appoint, that all and every the officers and clerks to be appointed as aforesaid shall have and receive respectively such reasonable salaries as the Chief Justice shall, from time to time, appoint for each office and place respectively, and as the Governor General in Council shall approve ofProvided always, and it is Our will and pleasure, that all and every the officers and clerks to be appointed as aforesaid shall be resident within the limits of the jurisdiction of the said Court, so long as they shall hold their respective offices but this proviso shall not interfere with or prejudice the right of any officer or clerk to avail himself of leave of absence under any rules prescribed by the Governor General in Council, and to absent himself from the said limits during the term of such leave, in accordance with the said rules4We do hereby appoint and ordain, that every clerk and ministerial officer of the said High Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal, appointed by virtue of the said Letters Patent of the Fourteenth of May, One thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, shall continue to hold and enjoy his office and employment, with the salary thereunto annexed, until he be removed from such office and employment and he shall be subject to the like power of removal, regulations, and provisions if he were appointed by virtue of these Letters Patent9But it is obvious from the last portion of clause 4 that such power was taken to be implicit under clause 8 and presumably as arising from the power of appointment10The power of removal or of taking other disciplinary action as regards such appointees was not in terms grantedBut there is historical evidence to show that the power of appointment conferred under the Charter was always understood as comprising the above powersSir Charles Wood, the then Secretary of State for India in paragraph 10 of his dispatch to the Governor General dated the 17th May, 1862, (on the formation of the new High Courts) stated as follows: The Supreme Court exercises an authority entirely independent of the Government in respect of its ministerial officers11It is this power and authority along with other judicial power and authority that was succeeded to by the High Courts (on their formation in supersession of the Supreme and Sadar Courts) by virtue of section 9 of the Indian High Courts Act, in the following terms1213All the powers under the Letters Patent were, however, subject to alteration by competent legislative authority by virtue of clause 44 of the Letters Patent1415They are as follows: 2291617Such continuance, therefore, can only operate by a process of adaptation implicitly Authorised by the very terms of section 276That rule shows that the Governor General in Council or Local Government of a Governors Province may impose any of the penalties specified in rule 49 (which includes dismissal) on any person included in any of the classes I to 5 specified in rule 14 who is serving under the administrative control of the Governor-general in Council or the Local Government, as the case may beThis rule, if it originally applied to the High Court staff, must after 1935 be read by substituting Chief Justice in the place of the Local Government wherever it occurs therein and making other consequential alterationsThis would be so even apart from the normal implication of the power of appointment specifically recognised under the Act18It must be mentioned, at this stage, that so far as the power of dismissal is concerned, the position under theConstitution of 1950 is not open to any argument or doubtThis results from section 16 of the General Clauses Act

delivered by : Sudhi Ranjan Das, J 132 of the Constitution of India the petitioners call in question the validity of the Punjab Special Powers (Press) Act, 1956 (being Act No38 of 1956), hereinafter referred to as  the impugned Act , and pray for an appropriate writ or order directing the respondents to withdraw the Notifications issued by them on the two petitioners as the editors, printers and publishers of two newspapers, Pratap and Vir Arjun2The Daily Pratap was started about 38 years back in Lahore, the capital of the united PunjabIt is a daily newspaper printed in the Urdu language and , scriptVirendra, the petitioner, in Petition No3The petitioners allege that after the appointment of the States Reorganisation Commission on December 29, 1953, the Akali party in the Punjab started a campaign for the partition of the State of Punjab on communal and linguistic basisAccording to the petitioners this agitation soon degenerated into a campaign of hatred which threatened the peace of the StateThe petitioners maintain that the Hindu inhabitants of the State belonging to all shades of opinion and also a section of the Sikh community and the Congress Party were strongly opposed to that proposal4It is in the circumstances reasonable to infer that the Hindus would also indulge in a counter propaganda in the Press and from the platform against the agitation started by the Akali partyIt is admitted that the policy of these two papers, the Daily Pratap and Vir Arjun, has been to oppose the Akali demand for partition of the State of PunjabObviously a good deal of tension was generated in the State by reason of the two bitterly opposing parties trying to propagate their respective ideologiesAbout a year back the Congress Party, which is the ruling party, is said to have surrendered to the communal pressure of the Akalies and accepted what has since come to be known as the regional formulaIt was amidst the din and bustle of this ideological war and to prevent and combat any possible activity prejudicial to the maintenance of communal harmony that the Legislature of the State of Punjab found it necessary to pass the impugned Act which received the assent of the President on October 19, 1956, and came into force on the 25th of the same month5The provisions of the impugned Act, in so far as they are material, may now be referred toS 2(1)(b) authorises the State Government or any authority so authorised in this behalf to require that any matter covering not more than two columns be published in any particular issue or issues of a newspaper or periodical on payment of adequate remuneration and to specify the period (not exceeding one week) during which and the manner in which such publication shall take placeClSub-s2 to order the seizure of all copies of any publication and of the printing press or other instrument or apparatus used in the publication7Sub-s3, to order the seizure of all copies of any newspaper, periodical, leaflet or other publication concernedSection 4 provides punishment for the contravention of any of the provisions of the Act by imprisonment of either description which may extend to one year or with fine up to one thousand rupees or with both8It appears that on or about May 30, 1957, a movement known as the save Hindi agitation was started by a Samiti which goes by the name of Hindi Raksha SamitiThe Arya Samaj, which claims to be a cultural and religious society, joined this campaign for changing what they conceive to be the objectionable features of the regional formula and the Sachar formula on languageThe petitioners who are the editors, printers and publishers of the two newspapers published simultaneously from Jullunder and New Delhi respectively consider that the objectionable clauses of those formulae are not only unjust and unfair to the cause of propagating that national language in the country, but are also a contrivance to secure the political domination of the minority community over the majorityAdmittedly the petitioners have been publishing criticisms and news concerning the agitation which, according to them, are quite fair and legitimate, but they allege that newspapers like Prabhat and Ajit, which support the Akali party in the State have been publishing articles and news couched in a strong and violent language against the  save Hindi agitation  and the Hindu communityThe agitation apparently followed the usual course and pattern of all political agitation of this kind with its attendant demonstrations, slogans and satyagraha by the volunteers and lathi charge by the policeEventually on July 10, 1957, the agitation culminated in the save Hindi agitation  volunteers forcible entry into the Secretariat of the Punjab Government at ChandigarhIt was in these circumstances that the four Notifications complained of were issued9It was in the following terms:  Whereas 1, Ranbir Singh, Home Secretary, Punjab Government, authorised by the said Government

restrictionsThe point to be kept in view is that the several rights of freedom guaranteed to the citizens by Art19(1) are exercisable by them throughout and in all parts of the territory of IndiaThe restrictions, so far as they extend, are certainly complete but whether they amount to a total prohibition of the exercise of the fundamental rights must be judged by reference to the ambit of the rights and, so judged, there can be no question that the entire rights under Arts14Learned counsel then urges that assuming these sections impose only restrictions they are, nevertheless, void as

([1952] SCR 597,607) 1952 Indlaw SC 33 in the following words:  It is-important in this context to bear in mind that the test of reasonableness, wherever prescribed, should be applied to each individual statute impugned, and no abstract standard or general pattern, of reason ableness can be laid down as applicable to all casesThe nature of the right alleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing conditions at the time, should all enter into the judicial verdict16This dictum has been adopted and applied by this Court in several subsequent casesThe surrounding circumstances in which the impugned law came to be enacted, the underlying purpose of the enactment and the extent and the urgency of the evil sought to be remedied have already been adverted toIt cannot be overlooked that the Press is a mighty institution wielding enormous powers which are expected to be exercised for the protection and the good of the people but which may conceivably be abused and exercised for anti- social purposes by exciting the passions and prejudices of a section of the people against another section and thereby disturbing the public order and tranquillity or in support of a policy which may be of a subversive characterThe powerful influence of the newspapers, for good or evil, on the minds of the readers, the wide sweep of their reach, the modern facilities for their swift circulation to territories, distant and near, must all enter into the judicial verdict and the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed upon the Press has to be tested against this backgroundIt is certainly a serious encroachment on the valuable and cherished right to freedom of speech and expression if a newspaper is prevented from publishing its own views or the views of its correspondent&-relating to or concerning what may be the burning topic of the dayOur Constitution recognises this necessity and has attempted to strike a balance between the two social interests19 (1) (a) and 19 (1) (g) reasonable in view of all the surrounding circumstances ?19(6) ?17It is conceded that a serious tension had arisen between the Hindus and the Akalis over the question of the partition of the State on linguistic and communal basisThe people were divided into two warring groups, one supporting the agitation and the other opposing itQuite conceivably this agitation might at any time assume a nasty communal turn and flare up into a communal frenzy and factious fight disturbing the public order of the State which is on the border of a foreign State and where consequently the public order and tranquillity were and are essential in the interest of the safety of the StateLegislature had to ask itself the question, who will be the appropriate authority to determine at any given point of time as to whether the prevailing cicumstances require some restriction to be placed on the right to freedom of speech and expression and the right to carry on any occupation, trade or business and to what extent?The answer was obvious, namely, that as the State Government was charged with the preservation of law and order in the State, as it alone was in possession of all material facts it would be the beat authority to investigate the circumstances and assess the urgency of the situation that might arise and to make up its mind whether any and, if so, what anticipatory action must be taken for the prevention of the threatened or anticipated breach of the peace The court is wholly unsuited to gauge the seriousness of the situation, for it cannot be in possession of materials which are available only to the executive GovernmentQuick decision and swift and effective action must be of the essence of those powers and the exercise of it must, therefore, be left to the subjective satisfaction of the Government charged with the duty of maintaining law and orderpurpose of the enactmentEven in his dissenting judgment in Dr N B Khare vThe State of Delhi ([1950] SCR 510) 1950 Indlaw SC 7 Mukherjea, J, conceded that in cases of this description certain authorities could be invested with power to make initial orders on their own satisfaction and not on materials which satisfy certain objective tests18We are referred to the observations of Mukherjea, J, in Dwarka Prasad Laxmi Narain vThe State of Uttar Pradesh ([1954] SCR 803,813) 1954 Indlaw SC 60That case does not seem to us to have any

J 132 of the Constitution of India the petitioners call in question the validity of the Punjab Special Powers (Press) Act, 1956 (being Act No38 of 1956), hereinafter referred to as  the impugned Act , and pray for an appropriate writ or order directing the respondents to withdraw the Notifications issued by them on the two petitioners as the editors, printers and publishers of two newspapers, Pratap and Vir Arjun2The Daily Pratap was started about 38 years back in Lahore, the capital of the united PunjabIt is a daily newspaper printed in the Urdu language and , scriptVirendra, the petitioner, in Petition No3The petitioners allege that after the appointment of the States Reorganisation Commission on December 29, 1953, the Akali party in the Punjab started a campaign for the partition of the State of Punjab on communal and linguistic basisAccording to the petitioners this agitation soon degenerated into a campaign of hatred which threatened the peace of the StateThe petitioners maintain that the Hindu inhabitants of the State belonging to all shades of opinion and also a section of the Sikh community and the Congress Party were strongly opposed to that proposal4It is in the circumstances reasonable to infer that the Hindus would also indulge in a counter propaganda in the Press and from the platform against the agitation started by the Akali partyIt is admitted that the policy of these two papers, the Daily Pratap and Vir Arjun, has been to oppose the Akali demand for partition of the State of PunjabObviously a good deal of tension was generated in the State by reason of the two bitterly opposing parties trying to propagate their respective ideologiesAbout a year back the Congress Party, which is the ruling party, is said to have surrendered to the communal pressure of the Akalies and accepted what has since come to be known as the regional formulaIt was amidst the din and bustle of this ideological war and to prevent and combat any possible activity prejudicial to the maintenance of communal harmony that the Legislature of the State of Punjab found it necessary to pass the impugned Act which received the assent of the President on October 19, 1956, and came into force on the 25th of the same month5The provisions of the impugned Act, in so far as they are material, may now be referred toS 2(1)(b) authorises the State Government or any authority so authorised in this behalf to require that any matter covering not more than two columns be published in any particular issue or issues of a newspaper or periodical on payment of adequate remuneration and to specify the period (not exceeding one week) during which and the manner in which such publication shall take placeClSub-s2 to order the seizure of all copies of any publication and of the printing press or other instrument or apparatus used in the publication7Sub-s3, to order the seizure of all copies of any newspaper, periodical, leaflet or other publication concernedSection 4 provides punishment for the contravention of any of the provisions of the Act by imprisonment of either description which may extend to one year or with fine up to one thousand rupees or with both8It appears that on or about May 30, 1957, a movement known as the save Hindi agitation was started by a Samiti which goes by the name of Hindi Raksha SamitiThe Arya Samaj, which claims to be a cultural and religious society, joined this campaign for changing what they conceive to be the objectionable features of the regional formula and the Sachar formula on languageThe petitioners who are the editors, printers and publishers of the two newspapers published simultaneously from Jullunder and New Delhi respectively consider that the objectionable clauses of those formulae are not only unjust and unfair to the cause of propagating that national language in the country, but are also a contrivance to secure the political domination of the minority community over the majorityAdmittedly the petitioners have been publishing criticisms and news concerning the agitation which, according to them, are quite fair and legitimate, but they allege that newspapers like Prabhat and Ajit, which support the Akali party in the State have been publishing articles and news couched in a strong and violent language against the  save Hindi agitation  and the Hindu communityThe agitation apparently followed the usual course and pattern of all political agitation of this kind with its attendant demonstrations, slogans and satyagraha by the volunteers and lathi charge by the policeEventually on July 10, 1957, the agitation culminated in the save Hindi agitation  volunteers forcible entry into the Secretariat of the Punjab Government at ChandigarhIt was in these circumstances that the four Notifications complained of were issued9It was in the following terms:  Whereas 1, Ranbir Singh, Home Secretary, Punjab Government, authorised by the said Government u/s(a) of cl2 of the said Act, 1 prohibit Shri Virendra, the printer, publisher and the editor of Pratap from printing and publishing any article, report, news item, letter or any other material of

suffice to set out the Notification in respect of Daily Pratap which ran as follows:  Punjab Government Gazette Extraordinary Published by Authority Chandigarh, Sunday, July 14, 1957Home Department Notification The 14th July, 1957, No8453-C(H)-57/14580:-Whereas 1, Ranbir Singh, Home Secretary to Government, Punjab, authorised by the said Government u/s12The petitioners contend that both ss19(6)13There is and can be no dispute that the right to freedom of speech and expression carries with it the right to propagate and circulate ones views and opinions subject to reasonable restrictionsThe point to be kept in view is that the several rights of freedom guaranteed to the citizens by Art19(1) are exercisable by them throughout and in all parts of the territory of IndiaThe restrictions, so far as they extend, are certainly complete but whether they amount to a total prohibition of the exercise of the fundamental rights must be judged by reference to the ambit of the rights and, so judged, there can be no question that the entire rights under Arts14Learned counsel then urges that assuming these sections impose only restrictions they are, nevertheless, void as being repugnant to the  Constitution, because the restrictions are not reasonable19(1)(a) it is qualified by Art19(1)(a) in the interests ofLikewise the right to carry on any occupation, trade or business guaranteed by Art19(1)(g)As has been explained by this Court in Ramji Lal Modi vThe State of U P (Petition No252 of 1955decided on April 5, 1957) the words  in the interests of  are words of great amplitude and are much wider than the words  for the maintenance of It is against this background, therefore, that we are to see whether the restrictions imposed by ss19(2) and 19(6)15V G Row ([1952] SCR 597,607) 1952 Indlaw SC 33 in the following words:  It is-important in this context to bear in mind that the test of reasonableness, wherever prescribed, should be applied to each individual statute impugned, and no abstract standard or general pattern, of reason ableness can be laid down as applicable to all casesThe nature of the right alleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing conditions at the time, should all enter into the judicial verdict16This dictum has been adopted and applied by this Court in several subsequent casesThe surrounding circumstances in which the impugned law came to be enacted, the underlying purpose of the enactment and the extent and the urgency of the evil sought to be remedied have already been adverted toIt cannot be overlooked that the Press is a mighty institution wielding enormous powers which are expected to be exercised for the protection and the good of the people but which may conceivably be abused and exercised for anti- social purposes by exciting the passions and prejudices of a section of the people against another section and thereby disturbing the public order and tranquillity or in support of a policy which may be of a subversive characterThe powerful influence of the newspapers, for good or evil, on the minds of the readers, the wide sweep of their reach, the modern facilities for their swift circulation to territories, distant and near, must all enter into the judicial verdict and the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed upon the Press has to be tested against this backgroundIt is certainly a serious encroachment on the valuable and cherished right to freedom of speech and expression if a newspaper is prevented from publishing its own views or the views of its correspondent&-relating to or concerning what may be the burning topic of the dayOur Constitution recognises this necessity and has attempted to strike a balance between the two social interests19 (1) (a) and 19 (1) (g) reasonable in view of all the surrounding circumstances ?19(6) ?17It is conceded that a serious tension had arisen between the Hindus and the Akalis over the question of the partition of the State on linguistic and communal basisThe people were divided into two warring groups, one supporting the agitation and the other opposing itQuite conceivably this agitation might at any time assume a nasty communal turn and flare up into a communal frenzy and factious fight disturbing the public order of the State which is on the border of a foreign State and where consequently the public order and tranquillity were and are essential in the interest of the safety of the StateLegislature had to ask itself the question, who will be the appropriate authority to determine at any given point of time as to whether the prevailing cicumstances require some restriction to be placed on the right to freedom of speech and expression and the right to carry on any occupation, trade or business and to what extent?The answer was obvious, namely, that as the State Government was charged with the preservation of law and order in the State, as it alone was in possession of all material facts it would be the beat authority to investigate the circumstances and assess the urgency of the situation that might arise and to make up its mind whether any and, if so, what anticipatory action must be taken for the prevention of the threatened or anticipated breach of the peace The court is wholly unsuited to gauge the seriousness of the situation, for it cannot be in possession of materials which are available only to the executive GovernmentQuick decision and swift and effective action must be of the essence of those powers and the exercise of it must, therefore, be left to the subjective satisfaction of the Government charged with the duty of maintaining law and orderpurpose of the enactmentEven in his dissenting judgment in Dr N B Khare vThe State of Delhi ([1950] SCR 510) 1950 Indlaw SC 7 Mukherjea, J, conceded that in cases of this description certain authorities could be invested with power to make initial orders on their own satisfaction and not on materials which satisfy certain objective tests18We are referred to the observations of Mukherjea, J, in Dwarka Prasad Laxmi Narain vThe State of Uttar Pradesh ([1954] SCR 803,813) 1954 Indlaw SC 60That case does not seem to us to have any

No12164/P of 1949The Judgment was delivered by : Bhuvaneshwar Prasad Sinha, J 1This is an appeal by special leave directed against the concurrent orders and judgments of the courts below convicting the appellant, under section 409, Indian Penal Code and sentencing him to rigorous imprisonment for three months and a fine of Rs201 or in default, further six weeks rigorous imprisonment, As the appellant had been convicted and sentenced for a similar offence in another case tried by the same Presidency Magistrate, 19th Court, Esplanade, Bombay, he directed the sentence in this case to run concurrently with the sentence in the other case409 of the Indian Penal Code for committing criminal breach of trust in respect of property to wit 3% Government Promissory Loan Notes 1966-68 of the face value of Rs50,000 and 2-1/4% Government Promissory Notes 1961 of the face value of Rs(Detailed charge is separately framed)2In 1944 the Cambay Hindu Merchants Co-operative Bank at Cambay, which hereinafter will be referred to as the Co- operative Bank50,000 were purchased likewise and left with the Exchange Bank for the same purposeOn the 14th May 1948 the two banks entered into a contract evidenced by three documents to be noticed in detail hereinafter375,000 will hereinafter be referred to as the securitiesOn the 28th April 1949 Messrs Merwanji Dalal & Co demanded back their money by the forenoon of the day following425,0005In spite of the best efforts of the appellant as the Managing Director of the Exchange Bank, to stave off the crisis by borrowing money from different sources, the run on the bank became so great that the directors applied for and obtained from the Company Judge of the Bombay High Court a moratorium of 15 daysOn the 18th May 1949 a provisional liquidator was appointed in respect of the Exchange Bank on a creditors application and on the 24th June 1949 the Official Liquidator was appointed to wind up the bankOn the 25th June 1949 one M N Raijee as agent of the Official Liquidator lodged information with the police charging the appellant with breach of trust in respect of a number of securities including the securities belongingOn the 4th April 1952 the charge as quoted above was framed against the appellantThe delay of about two and a half years in placing the appellant on trial is attributable to the fact that at the request of the accused the trial in respect of this charge was stayed pending the disposal of the other case against him6The second witness for the prosecution was a partner in the firm of Messrs Merwanji Bomanji Dalal during the material timeAccording to this witness, the appellant as the Managing Director exercised the powers of borrowing, raising money, purchasing, selling and pledging of bonds, scrips and other forms of securities on behalf of the Bank and its constituents during the relevant periodand that no one else exercised those powersHe also testified to the fact that there was a crisis in the affairs of the Bank from about the middle of February 1949-and that there was a rush on the Bank which continued till it closed downAs there was a heavy rush of depositors on the bank,the loan from the Canara Bank was taken to satisfy the demand of the depositorsThe most important witness examined on behalf of the prosecution is PW 4, Ganpati Venkatrao KiniLike the previous witness, he also had a power of attorney to act only in conjunction with another person holding a similar powerThe accused actually asked me for these securities and I handed them to the accused7- In fact, the accused himself told me to bring securities pleged by the Cambay Co-operative Bank with the Exchanage Bank8L, which is a very important document in this case and proves that it was signed by the accusedHe further states that the declaration in that document that the securities rep I resented the Exchange Banks investments was not correctHe was drawing Rs2,500 as monthly salary as the Managing Director1,000 from the Union Life Assurance Co Ltd, is its Managing DirectorThe Insurance Company and its branches had a current account with the Exchange Bank and had advanced to the latter six to seven lakhs of rupees as call depositsThe appellant was also connected with Messrs L A, Stronach Ltd, Advertising Agents, which had been given overdraft facilities by the Exchange Bank2,000 per month as salary from the aforesaid Advertising AgentsThe appellant and his wife were the principal shareholders in Akhaney & Sons Ltd, who were the Secretaries and Treasurers of the Indian Overseas AirlinesThe Exchange Bank had advanced to the aforesaid Indian Overseas Airlines a loan of one crore and ten lakhs of rupees and Messrs Akhaney & Sons Ltd aforesaid were getting a remuneration of Rs2,500 per month from the Indian Overseas Airlines LtdIt would thus appear that the appellant along with his wife in one way or another was getting about Rs8,000 per mensem as remuneration from the different companies referred to above which were closely associated with one another from the financial point of view and that the, appellant was the chief person concerned with them and the connecting link between themIt is in the background of all these facts and circumstances that the appellants acts of commission and omission had to be judgedThe other four witnesses, PWs5 to 8 are more or less formal witnesses in the sense that they have proved certain documents and letters which need not be noticedThe evidence of PW 2 had to be set aside as he was not available for cross-examination after charge, being out of the country9The appellants defence is disclosed in a long written statement running into twenty paragraphs and seven closely typed pages submitted on the 3rd October 1952Shortly stated, it is to the effect that the charge framed against him is bad in law and extremely vague; that the vagueness of the charge had considerably handicapped his defence, that the prosecution had not been fair in that it had not examined the first informant, M N Raiji, that if he had been examined by the prosecution, the appellant would have shown from the records in his possession that the Co-operative Bank had not suffered any loss and that the Bank in the hands of the Liquidator had more than sufficient funds to pay the dues of the former; that the prosecution bad not been launched with the sanction of the Company Judge who was in seisin of the liquidation proceedings in respect of the Exchange Bank and that therefore the provisions of ssE, F and G, between the two banks; that the sub-pledging of the securities with the Canara Bank or with Messrs Merwanji Bomanji Dalal was perfectlywithin the four corners of the law, and that the essential ingredients of an offence under section 409, Indian Penal Code had not been made outGrievance was also sought to be made of the fact that Inspector Milburn who had investigated the case had not been called as aprosecution witness, with the result that the appellant had been deprived of the right of challenging the prosecution evidence with reference to the police diary10The learned Magistrate after a very fair and full examination of the evidence in the case and the points raised by the appellant in his defence came to the conclusion that the appellant was guilty of the offence of criminal breach of trust under section 409, Indian Penal Code and passed a lenient sentence, as stated above, *in view of the, consideration that not a pie went to the pocket of the accused, and that the accused had not taken up any dishonest defence(2) of that sectionOn the question of the non-examination of the first informant, M N Raiji, and of the investigating police officer, the learned Magistrate observed that they were formal witnesses inasmuch as the facts of the case were not in dispute11Furthermore, the court observed that if the accused or his lawyer who defended him at the later stage of the prosecution, had applied to the court for their being examined, they could have been called as witnesses and subjected to cross-examination by the accusedBut no such, application had been madeAs regards want of sanction of the Company Judge, he held that s12On appeal to the Bombay High Court, a Division Bench of that court dismissed the appealsubstantially agreeing with the findings of the trial courtWhile dealing with the appeal on the question of sentence, the High Court pointed out that there was good evidence to support the inference that the appellant had been actuated by motives of personal benefit alsoIn that view of the matter the High Court maintained the conviction and the sentence passed by the trial MagistrateThe certificate was refused by that courtThereafter the13Examining the position with reference to the contract between the two banks, we find that Exhibits E, F and G, all dated the 14th May 1948, are parts of the same transaction and evidence the terms of the contract between themEx66,150 with interest at three per centper annum with half yearly restsExE, and Exper annum as aforesaidThe significant portion of the bond is in these terms:- and we agree and undertake that in the event of our failure to maintain the margin on the said movable property marketable securities and goods in the manner hereinafter provided or failing repayment on demand to you by us of the amount of such advance or credit with interest cost charges and expenses as aforesaid you shall be entitled, but not bound, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any of the said movable property marketable securities and goods by public auction or private contract in such manner and upon such terms and subject to such conditions as you may think fit without any reference to us or obtaining our consent, and the proceeds of such sale or disposal shall be applied first in payment of all costs charges and expenses of and incident to such sale or disposal and the enforcement of the pledge and charge in your favour hereby created, secondly in repaying the amount of such advance or credit with interest as aforesaid and all costs charges and expenses incurred by you in relation thereto not otherwise met including loss in exchange (if any) and all other debts and monies however due to you by us and lastly in payment to us of the surplus if any thereafter remaining, declaring as it is hereby expressly provided agreed and declared that this shall be continuing security to cover the amount of any advance or credit which you have allowed to us Or may from time to time allow us with interest costs, charges and expenses and all other debts and monies due as aforesaid14Reading Exhibits E, F and G together, it is clear that the securities of the face value of RsIt was further stipulated that in the event of the pledgor making a default in payment on demand of the amount advanced by way of overdraft with outstanding interest it may be realised by the Exchange Bank by sale of those securities and after satisfying the pledgees dues against the pledgor, if there was any outstanding amount the surplus of the sale proceeds shall be paid back to the pledgorSo long as those contingencies did not arise, and it is nobodys case that any of those contingencies had arisen, the pledgee bank had no right to deal with the securities by way of pledge, sub-pledge or assignmentIn this connection our attention was invited to the provisions of sIt was further argued that as there was nothing to show that the appellant had dealt with the securities for a larger amount than that, he could not be said to have contravened the terms of the contractIn our opinion, there is no substance in this contentionS 179 predicates that the pledgor has a limited interest which he can deal with and his transaction to that extent would be validBut so long as there was no overdraft by the pledgor, the pledgee bad no such interest as it could in its turn pledge or sub-pledge to a third partyWe are not here concerned with the question of the extent of interest acquired by such third party15We will now deal with the legal position, apart from the terms of the contractBy the very fact of the delivery of the securities to the bailee the latter became a trustee in terms of the contract, not for all purposes, but only for the, limited purpose indicated by the agreement between the partiesThe pledgor has in the present case only transferred his possession of the property to the pledgee who has a special interest in the property of enforcing his charge for payment of an overdraft, if any, whereas the property continues to be owned by the pledgor16The special interest of the pledgee comes to an end as soon as the debt for which it was pledged is dischargedIt is open to the pledgor to redeem the pledge by full payment of the amount for which the pledge had been made at any time if there is no fixed period for redemption, or at any time after the date fixed and such a right of redemption continues until the thing pledged is lawfully sold, bad no right to deal with them17It was next contended, alternatively, that assuming that the Exchange Bank had dealt with the securities in contravention of the terms of the agreement, the appellant had, as representing the bank, only committed a breach of contract, the remedy for which was a suit for damages and not a criminal prosecutionThis argument assumes that the same set of facts cannot give rise both to a civil liability and a criminal prosecutionIt is manifest that such an argument in its bald form cannot be acceptableIf there is no mens rea, or if the other essential ingredients of an offence are lacking, the same facts may not sustain a criminal prosecution, though a civil action may lieWe have therefore to examine whether or not there was mens rea in this case or whether the necessary element of a criminal18It has been contended that no offence under section 409, Indian Penal Code has been brought home to the appellant for the reasons, (1) that there was no entrustment, (2) that there was no mens rea, and (3) that there was no dishonesty on the part of the appellantthe property was entrustedThe contention is that the parties never contemplated the creation of a trust in the strict sense of the term405 which defines criminal breach of trust speaks of a person being in any manner entrusted with property, it does not contemplate the creation of a trust with all the technicalities of the law of trustIt contemplates the creation of a relationship whereby the owner of property makes it over to another person to be retained by him until a certain contingency arises or to be disposed of by him on the happening of a certain eventIn that capacity the appellant had dominion over the securitiesHence the appellant can be said either to have been entrusted with the property in a derivative sense or to have dominion over the securities as a banker, and thus in either case, the first essential condition for the application of section 409, Indian Penal Code is fulfilled19In our opinion, he intended both and, as202179 quoted above2223242522226", "Summary1000": "Jaswantrai

deprived of the right of challenging the prosecution evidence with reference to the police diary10The learned Magistrate after a very fair and full examination of the evidence in the case and the points raised by the appellant in his defence came to the conclusion that the appellant was guilty of the offence of criminal breach of trust under section 409, Indian Penal Code and passed a lenient sentence, as stated above, *in view of the, consideration that not a pie went to the pocket of the accused, and that the accused had not taken up any dishonest defence(2) of that sectionOn the question of the non-examination of the first informant, M N Raiji, and of the investigating police officer, the learned Magistrate observed that they were formal witnesses inasmuch as the facts of the case were not in dispute11Furthermore, the court observed that if the accused or his lawyer who defended him at the later stage of the prosecution, had applied to the court for their being examined, they could have been called as witnesses and subjected to cross-examination by the accusedBut no such, application had been madeAs regards want of sanction of the Company Judge, he held that s12On appeal to the Bombay High Court, a Division Bench of that court dismissed the appealsubstantially agreeing with the findings of the trial courtWhile dealing with the appeal on the question of sentence, the High Court pointed out that there was good evidence to support the inference that the appellant had been actuated by motives of personal benefit alsoIn that view of the matter the High Court maintained the conviction and the sentence passed by the trial MagistrateThe certificate was refused by that courtThereafter the13Examining the position with reference to the contract between the two banks, we find that Exhibits E, F and G, all dated the 14th May 1948, are parts of the same transaction and evidence the terms of the contract between themEx66,150 with interest at three per centper annum with half yearly restsExE, and Exper annum as aforesaidThe significant portion of the bond is in these terms:- and we agree and undertake that in the event of our failure to maintain the margin on the said movable property marketable securities and goods in the manner hereinafter provided or failing repayment on demand to you by us of the amount of such advance or credit with interest cost charges and expenses as aforesaid you shall be entitled, but not bound, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any of the said movable property marketable securities and goods by public auction or private contract in such manner and upon such terms and subject to such conditions as you may think fit without any reference to us or obtaining our consent, and the proceeds of such sale or disposal shall be applied first in payment of all costs charges and expenses of and incident to such sale or disposal and the enforcement of the pledge and charge in your favour hereby created, secondly in repaying the amount of such advance or credit with interest as aforesaid and all costs charges and expenses incurred by you in relation thereto not otherwise met including loss in exchange (if any) and all other debts and monies however due to you by us and lastly in payment to us of the surplus if any thereafter remaining, declaring as it is hereby expressly provided agreed and declared that this shall be continuing security to cover the amount of any advance or credit which you have allowed to us Or may from time to time allow us with interest costs, charges and expenses and all other debts and monies due as aforesaid14Reading Exhibits E, F and G together, it is clear that the securities of the face value of RsIt was further stipulated that in the event of the pledgor making a default in payment on demand of the amount advanced by way of overdraft with outstanding interest it may be realised by the Exchange Bank by sale of those securities and after satisfying the pledgees dues against the pledgor, if there was any outstanding amount the surplus of the sale proceeds shall be paid back to the pledgorSo long as those contingencies did not arise, and it is nobodys case that any of those contingencies had arisen, the pledgee bank had no right to deal with the securities by way of pledge, sub-pledge or assignmentIn this connection our attention was invited to the provisions of sIt was further argued that as there was nothing to show that the appellant had dealt with the securities for a larger amount than that, he could not be said to have contravened the terms of the contractIn our opinion, there is no substance in this contentionS 179 predicates that the pledgor has a limited interest which he can deal with and his transaction to that extent would be validBut so long as there was no overdraft by the pledgor, the pledgee bad no such interest as it could in its turn pledge or sub-pledge to a third partyWe are not here concerned with the question of the extent of interest acquired by such third party15We will now deal with the legal position, apart from the terms of the contractBy the very fact of the delivery of the securities to the bailee the latter became a trustee in terms of the contract, not for all purposes, but only for the, limited purpose indicated by the agreement between the partiesThe pledgor has in the present case only transferred his possession of the property to the pledgee who has a special interest in the property of enforcing his charge for payment of an overdraft, if any, whereas the property continues to be owned by the pledgor16The special interest of the pledgee comes to an end as soon as the debt for which it was pledged is dischargedIt is open to the pledgor to redeem the pledge by full payment of the amount for which the pledge had been made at any time if there is no fixed period for redemption, or at any time after the date fixed and such a right of redemption continues until the thing pledged is lawfully sold, bad no right to deal with them17It was next contended, alternatively, that assuming that the Exchange Bank had dealt with the securities in contravention of the terms of the agreement, the appellant had, as representing the bank, only committed a breach of contract, the remedy for which was a suit for damages and not a criminal prosecutionThis argument assumes that the same set of facts cannot give rise both to a civil liability and a criminal prosecutionIt is manifest that such an argument in its bald form cannot be acceptableIf there is no mens rea, or if the other essential ingredients of an offence are lacking, the same facts may not sustain a criminal prosecution, though a civil action may lieWe have therefore to examine whether or not there was mens rea in this case or whether the necessary element of a criminal18It has been contended that no offence under section 409, Indian Penal Code has been brought home to the appellant for the reasons, (1) that there was no entrustment, (2) that there was no mens rea, and (3) that there was no dishonesty on the part of the appellantthe property was entrustedThe contention is that the parties never contemplated the creation of a trust in the strict sense of the term405 which defines criminal breach of trust speaks of a person being in any manner entrusted with property, it does not contemplate the creation of a trust with all the technicalities of the law of trustIt contemplates the creation of a relationship whereby the owner of property makes it over to another person to be retained by him until a certain contingency arises or to be disposed of by him on the happening of a certain eventIn that capacity the appellant had dominion over the securitiesHence the appellant can be said either to have been entrusted with the property in a derivative sense or to have dominion over the securities as a banker, and thus in either case, the first essential condition for the application of section 409, Indian Penal Code is fulfilled19In our opinion, he intended both and, as202179 quoted above2223242522226\n"}

ordered to be returned for presentation; to the District Judges Court on November 30, 19425It was actually re-presented in that Court on December 2, 1942One of the questions raised in the suit was that the, suit was, barred by limitation on the ground that it must be taken to have been instituted not on October 23, [1941], but on December 2, 1942This plea was upheld by the trial CourtOn first -appeal-the District Judge held that the plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of S 14 of the Limitation Act and that the suit must be taken as having- been instituted on October 23, 1941 and is therefore, in timeHe accordingly decreed, the suit14 of the, Limitation Act, though raised, was not finally decided6The question as to the non- availability of the benefit of s14 of the Limitation Act to the plaintiff in the present suit has not been, urged before us and- the finding of the District Judge that the plaint must be taken to have been validly presented on October 23, 1941, standsThat date must, therefore, be taken to be the commencement of the action for the purposes of this appeal7It is the validity of these two parts of the argument which has to be considered8The facts relevant for this purpose are the followingAt the date when Venkata Reddy died his properties were in the custody of the two maternal uncles of his fatherHanimi Reddy filed his suit on the allegation, as already stated above, that he was the nearest agnatic relation alive of the deceased minor Venkata Reddy and as his next rightful heir to succeed to all the estate, movable and immovable, of the said minor, set forth in the schedules theretoHe appended a genealogical tree to his plaint which showed his relationship of Venkata Reddy through a common ancestor and showed only the two lines of himself and Venkata ReddyHe disputed that the father of the plaintiff and second defendant was descended from the common ancestor either by birth or by adoption, as shown in the genealogical table attached to the present plaintIt may be mentioned that in that part of the country (Andhra) an illatom son-in-law is a boy incorporated into the family with a view to give a daughter in marriage and is customarily recognised as an heir in the absence of a natural-born son, This claim appears to have been negatived and the suit was decreedDuring the pendency of the suit a Receiver was appointed in February, 1928910The relevant portion of his evidence is as follows: Annu Reddy (Hanimi Reddy) uncle of defendant  and myself filed 026 of 1927, District Court, Anantapur-same as OS No24 of 1928, Sub-Court, Anantapur-for the properties of the deceased Venkata ReddyAs Hanimi Reddy was the eldest member, he was attending to the conduct of that suitI was also coming to Court along with himThe suit ended in our favourIn cross-examination he said as follows: I told Hanimi Reddy that I would also join him as a party in OS 24 of 1928He said there was no need for me to join and that he would give my share to meI did not file any application to be impleaded as a defendant11There is nothing to indicate that either the plaintiff or the second defendant took any interest in those proceedings12The learned District Judge found on appeal (when the same was remanded to him for a finding by the High Court) as follows: I have no hesitation in holding that the plaintiff had nothing to do with the institution or conduct of the suit O S No13But there are some admitted and relevant facts brought out in evidence which are significantThe present evidence as well as the plaint in the earlier suit of 1927 show clearly that all the parties including Hanimi Reddy were residents of village MamuduruAll the suit properties are situated in that village itself; as appears from, the schedules to the plaint in the earlier suit1s father-in-law is the same1415Now, the ordinary classical requirement of adverse possession is that it should be nec vi nec clam nec precario(See Secretary of State for India vDebendra Lal Khan ( [1933] LR 61 IA 781933 IndLaw PC 58))The possession required must be adequate in continuity, in publicity and in extent to show that it is possession adverse to the competitor(See Radhamoni Debi vCollector of Khulna ([1900] LR 27 IA 1361900 IndLaw PC 23))But it is well-settled that in orderadverse, should be made out16(See Corea vAppuhamy ([1912] AC 230))It is a settled rule of law that as between co-heirs there must be evidence of open assertion of hostile title, coupled with exclusive possession and enjoyment by one of them to the knowledge of the other so as to constitute ousterThis does not necessarily mean that there must be an express demand by one and denial by the other17Whether that line of cases is right or wrong we need not pause to considerIt is sufficient to notice that the Privy Council in N Varada Pillai vJeevarathnammal (AIR 1919 PC 44 1918 Indlaw PC 27, 47) quotes, apparently with approval, a passage from Culley vDeod Taylerson (3 P & D 539; 52 RR 566) which indicates that such a situation may Tell lead to an inference of ouster if other circumstances concur(See also Govindrao vRajabai (AI R 1931 PC 48 1930 Indlaw PC 32))1819That knowledge is implicit in the very case that they have put forward in the present plaint20No doubt that specific case has been found against them and that finding is yes judicata between the partiesBut there is no reason why the admission as to the knowledge of the nature of the litigation and the contents of the plaint which such a case necessarily implies should not be attributed at least to the present plaintiff21This assumption is contrary to the admission of mutual knowledge of each others rights implicit in the plaintiffs case that Hanimi Reddy brought his suit with the consent of the plaintiff22In such circumstances and especially having regard to the fact that both the plaintiff and Hanimi Reddy were living in the same village and the plaintiff has put forward a false explanation to account for his inaction, a Court of fact might well have inferred ousterSitting on an appeal in special leave, however, we do not feel it desirable to decide the case on this groundWe, therefore, proceed to consider the further question that arises in the case, viz23In support of this contention he relies on the well-known legal principle that when a Court takes possession of properties through its Receiver, such Receivers possession is that of all the parties to the action according to their titlesIn Woodroffe on the Law relating to Receivers (4th Ed) at p63 the legal position is stated as follows:  The Receiver being the officer of the Court from which he derives his appointment, his possession is exclusively the possession of the Court, the property being regarded as in the custody of the law, in gremio legis, for the benefit of whoever may be ultimately determined to be entitled thereto24A Receiver is an officer of the Court and is not a particular agent of any party to the suit, notwithstanding that in law his possession is ultimately, treated as possession of the successful party on the termination of the suit25In such a case the question that would arise would be different, vizWe are not concerned with it in this case and express no opinion on it26The matter may be looked at from another point of viewIn Mitras Tagore Law

1The State of Punjab [1955] I SCR 1201 1955 Indlaw SC 66 and Suraj Pal vThe State of UP [1955] 1 SCR 1332 1955 Indlaw SC 6 and if so, to determine it234His co-accused was acquitted, so, it was urged, the element of common intention drops out and accordingly s34 cannot be called in aid302He relies on certain observations in Nanak Chand vThe State of Punjab [1955] 1 SCR 1201 1955 Indlaw SC 66 and contends that the conviction is an illegality which cannot be cured and claims that he must either be acquitted or, at the most, be retried, though be adds further that in the circumstances of this case the Court should not in the exercise of its discretion order a retrialThe charge was as follows: That you, on or about the 12th day of February 1953, at Civil Lines, Jabalpur, went with your brother Ronnie Slaney to the house of Mrs Waters (PW 20) at about 7 pmand in furtherance of the common intention did commit murder by intentionally or knowingly causing the death of her brother D Smythe and thereby committed an offence punishable u/sAn exactly similar charge with the necessary change of name was framed against the co-accused Ronnie Slaney334 are mere surplusage302 simpliciterWhat it narrows down to is this: Is the charge to be regarded as a ritualistic formula so sacred and fundamental that a total absence of one, or any departure in it from the strict and technical requirements of the Code, is so vital as to cut at the root of the trial and vitiate it from the start, or is it one of many regulations designed to ensure a fair and proper trial so that substantial, as opposed to purely technical, compliance with the spirit and requirements of the Code in this behalf is enough to cure departures from the strict letter of the law?4Before we proceed to set out our answer and examine the provisions of the Code, we will pause to observe that the Code is a code of procedure and, like all procedural laws, is designed to further the ends of justice and not to frustrate them by the introduction of endless technicalitiesThe object of the Code is to ensure that an accused person gets a full and fair trial along certain well-established and well-understood lines that accord with our notions of natural justiceIf he does, if he is tried by a competent court, if be is told and clearly understands the nature of the offence for which he is being tried, if the case against him is fully and fairly explained to him and he is afforded a full and fair opportunity of defending himself, then, provided there is substantial compliance with the outward forms of the law, mere mistakes in procedure, mere in consequential errors and omissions in the trial are regarded as venal by the Code and the trial is not vitiated unless the accused can show substantial prejudiceThat, broadly speaking, is the basic principle on which the Code is based5Now here, as in all procedural laws, certain things are regarded as vitalBut before looking into the Code, we deem it desirable to refer to certain decisions of the Privy Council because much of the judicial thinking in this country has been moulded by their observationsIn our opinion, the general effect of those decisions can be summarised as followsThe language of that Code is conclusive, and must be construed according to ordinary principles, so as to give effect to the plain meaning of the language usedNo doubt, in the case of an ambiguity, that meaning must be preferred which is more in accord with justice and convenience, but in general the words used read in their context must prevailBabulal Choukhani vThe King-Emperor [1938] LR 65 IA 158, 175And at page 177-  But, even so, that can be no ground why the Court should misconstrue the sectionTheir Lordships decide the question on what they regard as the plain meaning of the language used6Pulukuri Kotayya vKing-Emperor [1917] LR 74 IA 66, 757It is impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule but taken by and large the question usually narrows down to one of prejudiceThat was due to the language of the Judicial Committee in NA Subramania Iyer vKingEmperor [1901] LR 28 IA 257, 263 In Subramania Iyers case [1901] LR 28 IA 257, 263, the Privy Council said- The remedying of mere irregularities is familiar in most systems of jurisprudence, but it would be an extraordinary extension of such a branch of administering the criminal law to say that when the Code positively enacts that such a trial as that which has taken place here shall not be permitted that this contravention of the Code comes within the description of error, omission or irregularityKing- Emperor [1926] LR 54 IA 96, 109 as follows: The procedure adopted was one which the Code positively prohibited, and it was possible that it might have worked actual injustice to the accused8In our opinion, the key to the problem lies in the words underlinedExcept where there is something so vital as to cut at the root of jurisdiction or so abhorrent to what one might term natural justice, the matter resolves itself to a question of prejudiceSome violations of the Code will be so obvious that they will speak for themselves as, for example, a refusal to give the accused a hearing, a refusal to allow him to defend himself, a refusal to explain the nature of the charge to him and so forthIt hardly matters whether this is be- cause prejudice is then patent or because it is so abhorrent to well establisbed notions of natural justice that a trial of that kind is only a mockery of a trial and not of the kind envisaged by the laws of our land, because either way they would be struck down at onceIn still another class of case, the matter may be so near the border line that very slight evidence of a reasonable possibility of prejudice would swing the balance in favour of the accused9This, in our opinion, has been the trend of the more recent decisions of the Privy Council and indeed of latter-day criminal jurisprudence in England as well as in IndiaThe swing of the pendulum has been away from technicality, and a greater endeavour has been made to regard the substance rather than the shadow and to administer Justice fairly and impartially as it should be administered; fair to the accused, fair to the State and fair to the vast mass of the people for whose protection penal laws are made and administeredThe more recent attitude of the Judicial Committee is summed -up by Sir John Beaumont in Pulukuri Kotayya vKing- Emperor [1947] LR 74 IA 65, 75 where he says that- The distinction drawn in many of the cases in India between an illegality and an irregularity is one of degree rather than of kind and by Viscount Sumner in Atta Mohammad vKing-Emperor [1929] LR 57 IA 71,76 In the complete absence of any substantial injustice, in the complete absence of anything that outrages what is due to natural justice in criminal cases, their Lordships find it impossible to advise His Majesty to interfere10We prefer this way of stating the law, for the distinction that was once sought to be drawn between an express prohibition and an equally express provision positively stated strikes us as unrealIt will be observed that disregard of ail express Prohibition was regarded as curable in Zahiruddin v11It is possible (though we need not so decide in this case) that the recent amendment to s537 in the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act XXVI of 1955, where misjoinder of charges has been placed in the curable category, will set at rest the controversy that has raged around the true meaning of N A Subramania Iyer v146In any case, our opinion is that the real object of the Code is to leave these matters to the discretion and vigilance of the courtsSlightly to alter the language of the Privy Council in Babulal Choukhani vThe KingEmperor [1938] LR 5 IA 158,177 we would say- It must be hoped, and indeed assumed, that magistrates and judges will exercise their jurisdiction fairly and honestlySuch is the implied condition of the exercise of judicial powerIf they do not, or if they go wrong in fact or in law, the accused has prima facie a right of recourse to the superior courts by way of appeal or revision; and the cases show bow vigilant and resolute the High Courts are in seeing that the accused is not prejudiced or embarrassed by unsubstantial departures from the Code and bow closely and jealously the Supreme Court guards the position of the accusedThese safeguards may well have appeared to the Legislature to be sufficient when they enacted the remedial provisions of the Code and have now left them substantially unaltered in the new Code recently introduced12This, we feel, is the true intent and purpose of s537(a) which covers every proceeding taken with jurisdiction in the general phrase or other proceedings under this CodeIt is for the Court in all these cases to determine whether there has been prejudice to the accused; and in doing so to bear in mind that some violations are so obviously opposed to natural justice and the true intendment of the Code that on the face of them and without anything else they must be struck, down, while in other cases a closer examination of all the circumstances will be called for in order to discover whether the accused has been pre- judiced13Chapter XLV deals generally with irregular proceedings529states cate- gorically that they shall not vitiate the proceedingsCertain other irregularities are treated as vital and there the proceedings are void irrespective of prejudice530s 531, 532, 533, 535, 536 (2) and 537The examples we have given are illustrative and not exhaustiveWhat we are seeking to demonstrate is that the Code has carefully classified certain kinds of error and expressly indicates bow they are to be dealt withIn every such case the Court is bound to give effect to the express commands of the legislature: there is no scope for further speculationOur only task therefore is to interpret them and, having propounded their meaning, to give effect to whatever they say14271 (1)There can be no shirking that or slurring over it, and this must appear on the face of the recordThis is repeatedly reiterated in a number of sectionsThe whole question therefore is whether the charge must be formally reduced to writing and expressed as a ritualistic formula in order to save the trial from the fundamental defectof an incurable illegality or whether the information that is the substance of the matter can be conveyed in other waysThe question is whether we are to grasp at the substance or play hide and seek among the shadows of procedure15221 to 223 of the Code, which undoubtedly envisage a formal written charge, set out what a charge must containA perusal of them reveals the reasons why a charge is required223 says- When16It is clear to us that the object of the charge is not to introduce a provision that goes to the root of jurisdiction as, for example, the requirement of previous sanction under s197, but to enable the accused to have a clear idea of what he is being tried for and of the essential facts that he has to meetBut there are other ways of conveying this information242)The whole question is whether, in warrant cases and in sessions trials, the necessary information must be conveyed in one way and one way only, namely in a formal charge in order that the entire trial may not be ipso facto vitiated because of an incurable illegality, or whether that can be done in other and less formal ways, provided always that it is in fact conveyed in a clear and unambiguous man- ner and in circumstances that the court will regard as fair and in substantial, as opposed to purely technical, compliance with the requirements of the CodeThe law could have provided one way as easily as another, but what it has chosen to do is set out in the following sections225 is headed Effect of errorsThat, in our opinion, is reasonably plain language17197226) or even at the very end of the trial (section 227), and when this is done the trial need not proceed de novo but can go on from the stage at which the alteration was made provided neither side is prejudiced (s228)The proceedings up to the stage of the alteration, which, as ,we have seen, can be at the very end of the trial, are not vitiated unless there is prejudice; they are good despite these imperfectionsThat is impossible when the error is so vital as to cut at the root of the trial18In such a case, the High Court is empowered to direct a retrial only if, in its opinion, the accused was misled in his defence (s232)535The marginal note is Effect of omission to prepare charge, and the sHere again the language is clear and wide and emphatics 226, 227, 228 and 232537: Subject to etc no finding, sentence or order passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered under Chapter XXVLI or on appeal or revision on account- (a) of any error, omission or irregularity in the charge or other proceedings before or during trial19Reading these provisions as a whole, there is, in our opinion, no room left for doubt about what was intended20237 and 238 and he contended that no further departure is permissibleHe put his argument as follows21In answer to this the following argument was put to counsel and be was asked to meet itThe point was put this wayThis, it was said, follows from the words shall be deemed invalid237 and 23822We do not agree with either view233238237 and 238 as part of the normal procedureWhat then is the position if there is some departure from the normal procedure?225, 226) 227, 228, 535 and 537 furnish the answer and they apply with equal force to every kind of departure from that part of s225, 226, 227, 228, 535 and 5372324We have used the terms illegality and irregularity because they have acquired a technical significance and are convenient to demarcate a distinction between two classes of caseThey were first used by the Privy Council in N A Subramania Iyer vKingEmperor [1901] LR 28 IA 257 and repeated in Babulal Choukhani vKing-Emperor [1938] LR 65 IA 158,174 and in Pulukuri Kotayya vKing-Emperor [1947] LR 74 IA 65,75530) and others do not (s529)Proceedings that come under the former head are void535 which serves to validate it when that sort of irregularity has not occasioned a failure of justice25We do not attach any special significance to these termsThey are convenient expressions to convey a thought and that is allThe essence of the matter does not lie thereIt is embedded in broader considerations of justice that cannot be reduced to a set formula of words or rulesIt is a feeling, a way of thinking and of living that has been crystallized into judicial thought and is summed up in the admittedly vague and indefinite expression natural justice: something that is incapable of being reduced to a set formula of words and yet which is easily recognisable by those steeped in judicial thought and traditionIn the end, it all narrows down to this: some things are illegal, that is to say, not curable, because the Code expressly makes them so; others are struck down by the good sense of judges who, whatever expressions they may use, do so because those things occasion prejudice and offend their sense of fair play and justiceWhen so struck down, the conviction is invalid; when not, it is good whatever the irregularityIt matters little whether this is called an illegality, an irregularity that cannot be cured or an invalidity, so long as the terms are used in a clearly defined sense26535232 (1) in the cases with which it deals233 from being irregularities, then there is nothing left for ss535 and 537 to operate onIn our opinion, the truth is that the Code deals with the same subject-matter under different heads, so there is some overlapping27Section, 225 deals with the effect of errors relating to a charge233 to 240 deal with the joinder of charges28But, apart from that, if we examine the learned counsels contention more closely the fallacy in his argument becomes clearBut what are those cases?29They all deal with the same subject-matter and set out different aspects of it30233,234, 235 and 239 read as a whole, for the reasons we have just givenshould be regarded disjunctivelyIn our opinion, they between them (including ssWe say it because that accords with logic and principle and reason and because it touches the deep verities on which the structure of justice is erected and maintained31words that are not thereWe see no reason for straining at the mean- ing of these plain and emphatic provisions unless ritual and form are to be regarded as of the essence in criminal trialsWe are unable to find any magic or charm in the ritual of a chargeIt is the substance of these provisions that count and not their outward formTo hold otherwise is only to provide avenues of escape for the guilty and afford no protection to the innocent271(1) in sessions trials, s255(1) in warrant cases) but to say that a technical jargon of words whose significance no man not trained to the law can grasp or -follow affords him greater protection or assistance than the informing and the explaining that are the substance of the matter, is to base on fanciful theory wholly divorced from practical reality; and the same applies to the vast bulk of jurors who attend our courtsThey are none the wiser because of a formal charge except in a vague and general way that is of no practical accountThe essence of the matter is not a technical formula of words but the realityWas he told?Was it explained to him?Did he understand?Was it done in a fair way?32342 and 364; and yet no one doubts that irregularities there are curable271 that must be observed in a sessions trial rather than its letter and the essence of that lies in the words and explained to him271 requiresOf course, the rules should and ought to be punctually observed242 and complies with the spirit and object of s271 but omits to observe its technical formThen, when the witnesses are examined, the accused shows by his cross-examination that he knows just what he is being tried for342 and his answers show that he is under no delusionHe calls witnesses in defence to meet the very point or points the prosecution seek to make out against himHe puts in a written statement and is defended by an able lawyer who raises no objection from start to finishIf the Code says Yes, then there is an end of the matters 232 and 535 are susceptible of two meanings, surely they should be construed so as to accord with what will best serve the ends of justiceAnd yet that must be done if these words that are otherwise plain are construed in a strained and unnatural mannerOn the other hand, there is nothing in the view we take to imperil or harass an accused however innocent he may be271 (1) -and the examination under section 342?And yet, on the argument before us, an omission to observe these other rules that are of the substance is curable when there is no prejudice but not the sacred ritual of the framing of the charge; once that is there, the accused cannot be heard to say that be did not understand however much that may be the factSurely, this cannot be right33It is the substance that we must seekCourts have to administer justice and justice includes the punishment of guilt just as much as the protection of innocenceNeither can be done if the shadow is mistaken for the substance and the goal is lost in a labyrinth of unsubstantial technicalitiesBroad vision is required, a nice balancing of the rights of the State and the protection of society in general against protection from harassment to the individual and the risks of unjust convictionThe same broad principles of justice and fair play must be brought to bear when determining a matter of prejudice as in adjudging guilt34In adjudging the question of prejudice the fact that the absence of a charge, or a substantial mistake in it, is a serious lacuna will naturally operate to the benefit of the accused and if there is any reasonable and substantial doubt about whether he was, or was reasonably likely to have been, misled in the circumstances of any particular case, be is as much entitled to the benefit of it here as elsewhere; but if, on a careful consideration of all the facts, prejudice, or a reasonable and substantial likelihood of it, is not disclosed the conviction must stand; also it will always be material to consider whether objection to the nature of the charge, or a total want of one, was taken at an early stageIf it was not, and particularly where the accused is defended by counsel [Atta Mohammad vKing-Emperor [1929] LR 57 IA 71, 74], it may in a given case be proper to conclude that the accused was satisfied and knew just what he was being tried for and knew what was being alleged against him and wanted no further particulars, provided it is always borne in mind that no serious defect in the mode of conducting a criminal trial can be justified or cured by the consent of the advocate of the accused [Abdul -Rahman vKing-Emperor [1926] LR 54 IA 96,104, 110]There is no such thing as a judicial precedent on facts though counsel, and even judges, are sometimes prone to argue and to act as if there were3536The following cases afford no difficulty because they directly accord with the view we have set out at length aboveIn Lachman Singh vThe State )[1952] SCR 839, 848 1952 Indlaw SC 47 it was held that when there is a charge u/sThe decision in Karnail Singh vThe State of Punjab )[1954] SCR 904,911 1954 Indlaw SC 179 is to the same effect and the question about prejudice was also considered37Pandurang, Tukia and Bhillia vState of Hyderabad [1955] 1 SCR 1083 1954 Indlaw SC 173 also presents no difficulty because though the point was taken in that case it was expressly left open at page 1093The, State of UP [1955] ISCR, 1332 1955 Indlaw SC 6149But the evidence disclosed that the appellant had himself made an attempt on the life of one man and had himself shot another deadThose convictions were challenged hereThe conclusion reached on the facts was that prejudice was disclosed, so an acquittal was ordereds 307 and 302 simpliciter was in itself conclusive to establish prejudice and that therefore one need go no furtherIt is enough to say that that was not the decision and though that was one of the matters taken into consideration, the conclusion was based on a careful and lengthy investigation of all the facts in the case including the way in which it was conducted, the evidence of several witnesses, the medical evidence, the first information report and certain documents including two filed by the accused38Next comes Nanak Chand vThe, State of Punjab [1955] I SCR 1201 1955 Indlaw SC 6630239Now it is true that there are observations there which, without close examination, would appear to support the learned counsel for the appellantBut those observations must be construed in the light of the facts found, the most crucial fact being that/ patent prejudice was disclosedIt all depends on the circumstancesThe entire evidence and facts on which the learned Judges founded are not set out in the judgment but there is enough to indicate that had the appellants attention been drawn to his own part in the actual killing he would probably have cross- examined the doctor with more care and there was enough in the medical evidence to show that had that been done the appellant might well have been exoneratedIllustrations (c) and (e) to sIf the Court finds that a vital witness was not cross-examined when be might have been, and that if he had been, the further facts elicited might well have been crucial, then material from which prejudice can be inferred is at once apparent: that is exactly Illustrations (c) and (e)That, however, was, and remains, a pure conclusion of fact resting on the evidence and circumstances of that particular case40Now having reached the conclusion that there was prejudice, the learned Judges were of the opinion that the irregularity, if it can be so called when prejudice is disclosed was incurable and from that they concluded that an incurable irregularity is nothing but an illegality: a perfectly possible and logical conclusion when the words irregularity and illegality are not definedWe do not say that that is necessarily so but it is a reasonably plausible conclusion and was what the learned Judges had in mindIt is to be233233 and we can see no justification for giving it less weight than s237s 234, 235) 236 and 239 is just as mandatory as the portion that requires a separate charge for each offenceIt is unfortunate that we have no definition of the terms illegality, irregularity and in-validity because they can be used in differing senses, but however that may be, the decision we are now examining and the remarks made in that case must be read in the light of this backgroundWe agree that some of the expressions used in the judgment appear to travel wider than this but in order to dispel misconception we would now hold that the true view is the one we have propounded at length in the, present judgment41We now turn to the question of fact: is there material in this case to justify a finding of prejudice?221(4), (3) particulars of the time, s222(1) and (4) of the place, s223He is not entitled to any further information in the charge: see Illustration (e) to s223 of the Code: 42He is not entitled to know from the charge simpliciter any further circumstanceHow then is he expected to defend himself?He has the police challan, he has the evidence recorded in the Committal Court, he hears the prosecution witnesses and he is examined u/sIt is these proceedings that furnish him with all the necessary, and indeed vital, information, and it is his duty to look into them and defend himselfIt will be seen that if the logic of the appellants contention is carried to its fullest extent the accused could complain of prejudice because be was not told in the charge whether a pistol was used for the crime or a sword and if a pistol, its calibre and bore and the type of cartridge43Now when several persons join in the commission of a crime and share a common intention, it means that each has the requisite intention in himself; the fact that others share it does not absolve any one of them individually, and when the crime is actually committed in pursuance of the common intention and the accused is present at its commission, the crime becomes the offence actually committed because of s34s enunciate a principle of criminal liability44Now what are those legal conditions?It also means that he is informed that it is immaterial who struck the fatal blow4546Put at its highest, all that the appellant can urge is that a charge in the alternative ought to have been framed, which in itself imports that it could have been so framedAs was said by the Privy Counsel in Begu vKing-Emperor [1925] ILR 6 Lah226, 231 1925 Indlaw PC 23 and also by this Court in Lachman Singh vThat is what happened here47The variation between murder and concealing evidence after the crime is no more than the variation between killing a man jointly with another, sharing his intention, or allowing the other to do the actual killing with the same common intentionThe police charge-sheet states that the appellant hit the deceased with a hockey stick while his brother only threw stonesNo one could misunderstand thatNo witness suggests that anyone else hit the deceased on the headThere was no pos- sibility of misunderstanding or mistakeThe fact that the appellant did not attempt to confront any of the witnesses with their statements before either the Committing Magistrate or the police on this point shows that the witnesses told a consistent story from the startHe was told clearly and unambiguously that the evidence was that he hit the deceased over the head48Now what was his defence?A curious procedure was adopted, a procedure that has been condemned by the Nagpur High Court in other cases and which we regret to see still persistsInstead of the accused speaking for himself he made a statement through his advocateHowever, the defence was this: (1) an alibi: I wasnt there(2) It was dark and the deceased rushed at the appellant (who is now said to have been there despite the alibi), fell down the stairs and broke his head; (3) The deceased was the aggressor and the appellant struck him in self defence49Next, what was the cross-examination of the only eye-witness?There was no suggestion that she was mistaken in her identity, whereas she was cross examined about this very matter of self defence and questions were put to show that the deceased and not his brother had threatened the appellant with his fist50In the High Court the plea of alibi was dropped and the only argument advanced was self defenceThere was no hint of prejudice even in the grounds of appealOn the contrary, there was a clear admission in the High Court that he did hit the man but that he acted in self defenceAs the Privy Council said in Atta Mohammad vEmperor [1929] LR 57 IA 71, 74 He appeared by an advocate on the appeal and had been legally defended at the trial, and it is as clear as possible that, with full knowledge of the course which the trial had taken, neither the appellant himself nor those who represented him bad any sense whatever of the injustice that is now urged or any idea of his having been deprived of the opportunity of knowing the charge on which he was tried or of raising defences appropriate to that charge51The injury was inflicted with a hockey stickThe head was fractured but the deceased lived for ten daysThe doctor says- I consider the head injury on the head of Smythe was of a very serious nature and was likely to result in fatal consequencesTherefore, the doctor in whose care the patient was till he died places the injury no higher than likely to cause death52The doctor thought that it was only likely to cause deathThe appellant is only 22 years old and not a doctor and can hardly be presumed to have bad this special knowledge at the time he struck the blowAll blows on the head do not necessarily cause death, and as the deceased lived for ten days, we are unable to deduce from the nature of the injury and from the mere fact of death that the appellant had, or should have had, the special knowledge that sAdmittedly, there was no premeditation and there was a sudden fight, so we are unable to ascribe the necessary knowledge to the appellant; nor was the injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death53On the question of sentenceThere was no enmity according to the finding of the learned Sessions JudgeThe appellant did not go there armed with a stickHe was in love with the deceaseds sister who reciprocated his affection but could not marry him be-cause her husband had turned her out in England ,and she had no divorceThe deceased, who was the girls brother, resented thisThe appellant went to the house and asked the sister to come downThe brother came instead and there was a quarrelThe appellant slapped the deceased across the faceThe deceased, who was a big and strong man, shook his fist in the appellants face and the appellant snatched a hockey stick from his younger brother Ronnie and hit the deceased one blow over the bead and two blows on the hipsIn the circumstances, we think five years rigorous imprisonment will sufficeCHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J 54The State of Punjab [1955] 1 SC R 1201 1955 Indlaw SC 66 and Suraj Pal vThe State of U P [1955] 1 SCR 1332 1955 Indlaw SC 655This was the line of reasoning in Nanak Chands caseIn Suraj Pals case, the same line is taken but the absence of a specific charge is treated as a serious lacuna merely; and not regarded as an illegality56Ronnie was acquittedBut William was found guilty and sentenced to transportation for lifeAs pointed out by Lord Sumner in his classic judgment in Barendra Kumar Ghosh vThe King-Emperor [1924] LR 52 IA 40, there is much difference in the scope and applicability of ss34 and 149, though they have some resemblance and are to some extent overlappingare again compared and contrasted in Karnail Singh and another vThe State of Punjab [1954] SCR 904 1954 Indlaw SC 179149 doesIn a charge under section 34, there is active participation in the commission of the criminal act; under section 149, the liability arises by reason of the membership of the unlawful assembly with a common object, and there may be no active participation at all in the perpetration or commission of the crimeBut whereas in this case, the appellant has been individually charged with murder and there is proof that his band caused the injury, the fact that his brother was also sought to be made liable owing to the existence of a common intention, is neither here nor there, so far as the legality of the conviction is concerned, as there has been no prejudice by way of failure of justicelengthy arguments addressed to us, to consider the main question arising on the reference34 also stood on the same footingIn our attempt to resolve the conflict, we covered a wide area of ss and decisionsA detailed discussion of all the decisions cited at the Bar is not of much use as it is not possible to gather from a study of those cases anything very decisive by way of any guiding principleBut a few of them, more important than the rest, must be noticed57530The word illegality was used almost for the first time in the judgment of the Privy Council, LR 28 Indian Appeals 257 (familiarly known as Subramania Aiyars case), where they speak of a contravention of s234 of the Code, resulting in a misjoinder of charges, as an illegalityThe idea that it was a mere irregularity was repelled in these words:- Their Lordships are unable to regard the disobedience to an express provision as to a mode of trial as a mere irregularitySuch a phrase as irregularity is not appropriate to the illegality of trying an accused person for many different offences at the same time, and those offences being spread over a longer period than by law could have been joined together in one indictmentitself sufficiently shows what was meantAgain, they say:- It would be an extraordinary extension of such a branch of administering the criminal law to say that when the Code positively enacts that such a trial as that which has taken place here shall not be permitted that this contravention of the Code comes within the description of error, omission, or irregularity58Subsequently, however, there have been systematic attempts to explain away the said decision and restrict its scope to narrow limitsIn passing, it may be mentioned here that the legislature has now specifically included misjoinder of charges in sub- cl537In Abdul Rahman v53716259227602376153762227)g6364656667304300697053571727374", "Summary1000": "Willie (William) Slaney v State of Madhya Pradesh Supreme Court of India  31 October 1955 CrANo6  of 1955 The Judgment was delivered by : Vivian Bose, J 1The State of Punjab [1955] I SCR 1201 1955 Indlaw SC 66 and Suraj Pal vThe State of UP [1955] 1 SCR 1332 1955 Indlaw SC 6 and if so, to determine it234His co-accused was acquitted, so, it was urged, the element of common intention drops out and accordingly s34 cannot be called in aid302He relies on certain observations in Nanak Chand vThe State of Punjab [1955] 1 SCR 1201 1955 Indlaw SC 66 and contends that the conviction is an illegality which cannot be cured and claims that he must either be acquitted or, at the most, be retried, though be adds further that in the circumstances of this case the Court should not in the exercise of its discretion order a retrialThe charge was as follows: That you, on or about the 12th day of February 1953, at Civil Lines, Jabalpur, went with your brother Ronnie Slaney to the house of Mrs Waters (PW 20) at about 7 pmand in furtherance of the common intention did commit murder by intentionally or knowingly causing the death of her brother D Smythe and thereby committed an offence punishable u/sAn exactly similar charge with the necessary change of name was framed against the co-accused Ronnie Slaney334 are mere surplusage302 simpliciterWhat it narrows down to is this: Is the charge to be regarded as a ritualistic formula so sacred and fundamental that a total absence of one, or any departure in it from the strict and technical requirements of the Code, is so vital as to cut at the root of the trial and vitiate it from the start, or is it one of many regulations designed to ensure a fair and proper trial so that substantial, as opposed to purely technical, compliance with the spirit and requirements of the Code in this behalf is enough to cure departures from the strict letter of the law?4Before we proceed to set out our answer and examine the provisions of the Code, we will pause to observe that the Code is a code of procedure and, like all procedural laws, is designed to further the ends of justice and not to frustrate them by the introduction of endless technicalitiesThe object of the Code is to ensure that an accused person gets a full and fair trial along certain well-established and well-understood lines that accord with our notions of natural justiceIf he does, if he is tried by a competent court, if be is told and clearly understands the nature of the offence for which he is being tried, if the case against him is fully and fairly explained to him and he is afforded a full and fair opportunity of defending himself, then, provided there is substantial compliance with the outward forms of the law, mere mistakes in procedure, mere in consequential errors and omissions in the trial are regarded as venal by the Code and the trial is not vitiated unless the accused can show substantial prejudiceThat, broadly speaking, is the basic principle on which the Code is based5Now here, as in all procedural laws, certain things are regarded as vitalBut before looking into the Code, we deem it desirable to refer to certain decisions of the Privy Council because much of the judicial thinking in this country has been moulded by their observationsIn our opinion, the general effect of those decisions can be summarised as followsThe language of that Code is conclusive, and must be construed according to ordinary principles, so as to give effect to the plain meaning of the language usedNo doubt, in the case of an ambiguity, that meaning must be preferred which is more in accord with justice and convenience, but in general the words used read in their context must prevailBabulal Choukhani vThe King-Emperor [1938] LR 65 IA 158, 175And at page 177-  But, even so, that can be no ground why the Court should misconstrue the sectionTheir Lordships decide the question on what they regard as the plain meaning of the language used6Pulukuri Kotayya vKing-Emperor [1917] LR 74 IA 66, 757It is impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule but taken by and large the question usually narrows down to one of prejudiceThat was due to the language of the Judicial Committee in NA Subramania Iyer vKingEmperor [1901] LR 28 IA 257, 263 In Subramania Iyers case [1901] LR 28 IA 257, 263, the Privy Council said- The remedying of mere irregularities is familiar in most systems of jurisprudence, but it would be an extraordinary extension of such a branch of administering the criminal law to say that when the Code positively enacts that such a trial as that which has taken place here shall not be permitted that this contravention of the Code comes within the description of error, omission or irregularityKing- Emperor [1926] LR 54 IA 96, 109 as follows: The procedure adopted was one which the Code positively prohibited, and it was possible that it might have worked actual injustice to the accused8In our opinion, the key to the problem lies in the words underlinedExcept where there is something so vital as to cut at the root of jurisdiction or so abhorrent to what one might term natural justice, the matter resolves itself to a question of prejudiceSome violations of the Code will be so obvious that they will speak for themselves as, for example, a refusal to give the accused a hearing, a refusal to allow him to defend himself, a refusal to explain the nature of the charge to him and so forthIt hardly matters whether this is be- cause prejudice is then patent or because it is so abhorrent to well establisbed notions of natural justice that a trial of that kind is only a mockery of a trial and not of the kind envisaged by the laws of our land, because either way they would be struck down at onceIn still another class of case, the matter may be so near the border line that very slight evidence of a reasonable possibility of prejudice would swing the balance in favour of the accused9This, in our opinion, has been the trend of the more recent decisions of the Privy Council and indeed of latter-day criminal jurisprudence in England as well as in IndiaThe swing of the pendulum has been away from technicality, and a greater endeavour has been made to regard the substance rather than the shadow and to administer Justice fairly and impartially as it should be administered fair to the accused, fair to the State and fair to the vast mass of the people for whose protection penal laws are made and administeredThe more recent attitude of the Judicial Committee is summed -up by Sir John Beaumont in Pulukuri Kotayya vKing- Emperor [1947] LR 74 IA 65, 75 where he says that- The distinction drawn in many of the cases in India between an illegality and an irregularity is one of degree rather than of kind and by Viscount Sumner in Atta Mohammad vKing-Emperor [1929] LR 57 IA 71,76 In the complete absence of any substantial injustice, in the complete absence of anything that outrages what is due to natural justice in criminal cases, their Lordships find it impossible to advise His Majesty to interfere10We prefer this way of stating the law, for the distinction that was once sought to be drawn between an express prohibition and an equally express provision positively stated strikes us as unrealIt will be observed that disregard of ail express Prohibition was regarded as curable in Zahiruddin v11It is possible (though we need not so decide in this case) that the recent amendment to s537 in the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act XXVI of 1955, where misjoinder of charges has been placed in the curable category, will set at rest the controversy that has raged around the true meaning of N A Subramania Iyer v146In any case, our opinion is that the real object of the Code is to leave these matters to the discretion and vigilance of the courtsSlightly to alter the language of the Privy Council in Babulal Choukhani vThe KingEmperor [1938] LR 5 IA 158,177 we would say- It must be hoped, and indeed assumed, that magistrates and judges will exercise their jurisdiction fairly and honestlySuch is the implied condition of the exercise of judicial powerIf they do not, or if they go wrong in fact or in law, the accused has prima facie a right of recourse to the superior courts by way of appeal or revision and the cases show bow vigilant and resolute the High Courts are in seeing that the accused is not prejudiced or embarrassed by unsubstantial departures from the Code and bow closely and jealously the Supreme Court guards the position of the accusedThese safeguards may well have appeared to the Legislature to be sufficient when they enacted the remedial provisions of the Code and have now left them substantially unaltered in the new Code recently introduced12This, we feel, is the true intent and purpose of s537(a) which covers every proceeding taken with jurisdiction in the general phrase or other proceedings under this CodeIt is for the Court in all these cases to determine whether there has been prejudice to the accused and in doing so to bear in mind that some violations are so obviously opposed to natural justice and the true intendment of the Code that on the face of them and without anything else they must be struck, down, while in other cases a closer examination of all the circumstances will be called for in order to discover whether the accused has been pre- judiced13Chapter XLV deals generally with irregular proceedings529states cate- gorically that they shall not vitiate the proceedingsCertain other irregularities are treated as vital and there the proceedings are void irrespective of prejudice530s 531, 532, 533, 535, 536 (2) and 537The examples we have given are illustrative and not exhaustiveWhat we are seeking to demonstrate is that the Code has carefully classified certain kinds of error and expressly indicates bow they are to be dealt withIn every such case the Court is bound to give effect to the express commands of the legislature: there is no scope for further speculationOur only task therefore is to interpret them and, having propounded their meaning, to give effect to whatever they say14271 (1)There can be no shirking that or slurring over it, and this must appear on the face of the recordThis is repeatedly reiterated in a number of sectionsThe whole question therefore is whether the charge must be formally reduced to writing and expressed as a ritualistic formula in order to save the trial from the fundamental defectof an incurable illegality or whether the information that is the substance of the matter can be conveyed in other waysThe question is whether we are to grasp at the substance or play hide and seek among the shadows of procedure15221 to 223 of the Code, which undoubtedly envisage a formal written charge, set out what a charge must containA perusal of them reveals the reasons why a charge is required223 says- When16It is clear to us that the object of the charge is not to introduce a provision that goes to the root of jurisdiction as, for example, the requirement of previous sanction under s197, but to enable the accused to have a clear idea of what he is being tried for and of the essential facts that he has to meetBut there are other ways of conveying this information242)The whole question is whether, in warrant cases and in sessions trials, the necessary information must be conveyed in one way and one way only, namely in a formal charge in order that the entire trial may not be ipso facto vitiated because of an incurable illegality, or whether that can be done in other and less formal ways, provided always that it is in fact conveyed in a clear and unambiguous man- ner and in circumstances that the court will regard as fair and in substantial, as opposed to purely technical, compliance with the requirements of the CodeThe law could have provided one way as easily as another, but what it has chosen to do is set out in the following sections225 is headed Effect of errorsThat, in our opinion, is reasonably plain language17197226) or even at the very end of the trial (section 227), and when this is done the trial need not proceed de novo but can go on from the stage at which the alteration was made provided neither side is prejudiced (s228)The proceedings up to the stage of the alteration, which, as ,we have seen, can be at the very end of the trial, are not vitiated unless there is prejudice they are good despite these imperfectionsThat is impossible when the error is so vital as to cut at the root of the trial18In such a case, the High Court is empowered to direct a retrial only if, in its opinion, the accused was misled in his defence (s232)535The marginal note is Effect of omission to prepare charge, and the sHere again the language is clear and wide and emphatics 226, 227, 228 and 232537: Subject to etc no finding, sentence or order passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered under Chapter XXVLI or on appeal or revision on account- (a) of any error, omission or irregularity in the charge or other proceedings before or during trial19Reading these provisions as a whole, there is, in our opinion, no room left for doubt about what was intended20237 and 238 and he contended that no further departure is permissibleHe put his argument as follows21In answer to this the following argument was put to counsel and be was asked to meet itThe point was put this wayThis, it was said, follows from the words shall be deemed invalid237 and 23822We do not agree with either view233238237 and 238 as part of the normal procedureWhat then is the position if there is some departure from the normal procedure?225, 226) 227, 228, 535 and 537 furnish the answer and they apply with equal force to every kind of departure from that part of s225, 226, 227, 228, 535 and 5372324We have used the terms illegality and irregularity because they have acquired a technical significance and are convenient to demarcate a distinction between two classes of caseThey were first used by the Privy Council in N A Subramania Iyer vKingEmperor [1901] LR 28 IA 257 and repeated in Babulal Choukhani vKing-Emperor [1938] LR 65 IA 158,174 and in Pulukuri Kotayya vKing-Emperor [1947] LR 74 IA 65,75530) and others do not (s529)Proceedings that come under the former head are void535 which serves to validate it when that sort of irregularity has not occasioned a failure of justice25We do not attach any special significance to these termsThey are convenient expressions to convey a thought and that is allThe essence of the matter does not lie thereIt is embedded in broader considerations of justice that cannot be reduced to a set formula of words or rulesIt is a feeling, a way of thinking and of living that has been crystallized into judicial thought and is summed up in the admittedly vague and indefinite expression natural justice: something that is incapable of being reduced to a set formula of words and yet which is easily recognisable by those steeped in judicial thought and traditionIn the end, it all narrows down to this: some things are illegal, that is to say, not curable, because the Code expressly makes them so others are struck down by the good sense of judges who, whatever expressions they may use, do so because those things occasion prejudice and offend their sense of fair play and justiceWhen so struck down, the conviction is invalid when not, it is good whatever the irregularityIt matters little whether this is called an illegality, an irregularity that cannot be cured or an invalidity, so long as the terms are used in a clearly defined sense26535232 (1) in the cases with which it deals233 from being irregularities, then there is nothing left for ss535 and 537 to operate onIn our opinion, the truth is that the Code deals with the same subject-matter under different heads, so there is some overlapping27Section, 225 deals with the effect of errors relating to a charge233 to 240 deal with the joinder of charges28But, apart from that, if we examine the learned counsels contention more closely the fallacy in his argument becomes clearBut what are those cases?29They all deal with the same subject-matter and set out different aspects of it30233,234, 235 and 239 read as a whole, for the reasons we have just givenshould be regarded disjunctivelyIn our opinion, they between them (including ssWe say it because that accords with logic and principle and reason and because it touches the deep verities on which the structure of justice is erected and maintained31words that are not thereWe see no reason for straining at the mean- ing of these plain and emphatic provisions unless ritual and form are to be regarded as of the essence in criminal trialsWe are unable to find any magic or charm in the ritual of a chargeIt is the substance of these provisions that count and not their outward formTo hold otherwise is only to provide avenues of escape for the guilty and afford no protection to the innocent271(1) in sessions trials, s255(1) in warrant cases) but to say that a technical jargon of words whose significance no man not trained to the law can grasp or -follow affords him greater protection or assistance than the informing and the explaining that are the substance of the matter, is to base on fanciful theory wholly divorced from practical reality and the same applies to the vast bulk of jurors who attend our courtsThey are none the wiser because of a formal charge except in a vague and general way that is of no practical accountThe essence of the matter is not a technical formula of words but the realityWas he told?Was it explained to him?Did he understand?Was it done in a fair way?32342 and 364 and yet no one doubts that irregularities there are curable271 that must be observed in a sessions trial rather than its letter and the essence of that lies in the words and explained to him271 requiresOf course, the rules should and ought to be punctually observed242 and complies with the spirit and object of s271 but omits to observe its technical formThen, when the witnesses are examined, the accused shows by his cross-examination that he knows just what he is being tried for342 and his answers show that he is under no delusionHe calls witnesses in defence to meet the very point or points the prosecution seek to make out against himHe puts in a written statement and is defended by an able lawyer who raises no objection from start to finishIf the Code says Yes, then there is an end of the matters 232 and 535 are susceptible of two meanings, surely they should be construed so as to accord with what will best serve the ends of justiceAnd yet that must be done if these words that are otherwise plain are construed in a strained and unnatural mannerOn the other hand, there is nothing in the view we take to imperil or harass an accused however innocent he may be271 (1) -and the examination under section 342?And yet, on the argument before us, an omission to observe these other rules that are of the substance is curable when there is no prejudice but not the sacred ritual of the framing of the charge once that is there, the accused cannot be heard to say that be did not understand however much that may be the factSurely, this cannot be right33It is the substance that we must seekCourts have to administer justice and justice includes the punishment of guilt just as much as the protection of innocenceNeither can be done if the shadow is mistaken for the substance and the goal is lost in a labyrinth of unsubstantial technicalitiesBroad vision is required, a nice balancing of the rights of the State and the protection of society in general against protection from harassment to the individual and the risks of unjust convictionThe same broad principles of justice and fair play must be brought to bear when determining a matter of prejudice as in adjudging guilt34In adjudging the question of prejudice the fact that the absence of a charge, or a substantial mistake in it, is a serious lacuna will naturally operate to the benefit of the accused and if there is any reasonable and substantial doubt about whether he was, or was reasonably likely to have been, misled in the circumstances of any particular case, be is as much entitled to the benefit of it here as elsewhere but if, on a careful consideration of all the facts, prejudice, or a reasonable and substantial likelihood of it, is not disclosed the conviction must stand also it will always be material to consider whether objection to the nature of the charge, or a total want of one, was taken at an early stageIf it was not, and particularly where the accused is defended by counsel [Atta Mohammad vKing-Emperor [1929] LR 57 IA 71, 74], it may in a given case be proper to conclude that the accused was satisfied and knew just what he was being tried for and knew what was being alleged against him and wanted no further particulars, provided it is always borne in mind that no serious defect in the mode of conducting a criminal trial can be justified or cured by the consent of the advocate of the accused [Abdul -Rahman vKing-Emperor [1926] LR 54 IA 96,104, 110]There is no such thing as a judicial precedent on facts though counsel, and even judges, are sometimes prone to argue and to act as if there were3536The following cases afford no difficulty because they directly accord with the view we have set out at length aboveIn Lachman Singh vThe State )[1952] SCR 839, 848 1952 Indlaw SC 47 it was held that when there is a charge u/sThe decision in Karnail Singh vThe State of Punjab )[1954] SCR 904,911 1954 Indlaw SC 179 is to the same effect and the question about prejudice was also considered37Pandurang, Tukia and Bhillia vState of Hyderabad [1955] 1 SCR 1083 1954 Indlaw SC 173 also presents no difficulty because though the point was taken in that case it was expressly left open at page 1093The, State of UP [1955] ISCR, 1332 1955 Indlaw SC 6149But the evidence disclosed that the appellant had himself made an attempt on the life of one man and had himself shot another deadThose convictions were challenged hereThe conclusion reached on the facts was that prejudice was disclosed, so an acquittal was ordereds 307 and 302 simpliciter was in itself conclusive to establish prejudice and that therefore one need go no furtherIt is enough to say that that was not the decision and though that was one of the matters taken into consideration, the conclusion was based on a careful and lengthy investigation of all the facts in the case including the way in which it was conducted, the evidence of several witnesses, the medical evidence, the first information report and certain documents including two filed by the accused38Next comes Nanak Chand vThe, State of Punjab [1955] I SCR 1201 1955 Indlaw SC 6630239Now it is true that there are observations there which, without close examination, would appear to support the learned counsel for the appellantBut those observations must be construed in the light of the facts found, the most crucial fact being that/ patent prejudice was disclosedIt all depends on the circumstancesThe entire evidence and facts on which the learned Judges founded are not set out in the judgment but there is enough to indicate that had the appellants attention been drawn to his own part in the actual killing he would probably have cross- examined the doctor with more care and there was enough in the medical evidence to show that had that been done the appellant might well have been exoneratedIllustrations (c) and (e) to sIf the Court finds that a vital witness was not cross-examined when be might have been, and that if he had been, the further facts elicited might well have been crucial, then material from which prejudice can be inferred is at once apparent: that is exactly Illustrations (c) and (e)That, however, was, and remains, a pure conclusion of fact resting on the evidence and circumstances of that particular case40Now having reached the conclusion that there was prejudice, the learned Judges were of the opinion that the irregularity, if it can be so called when prejudice is disclosed was incurable and from that they concluded that an incurable irregularity is nothing but an illegality: a perfectly possible and logical conclusion when the words irregularity and illegality are not definedWe do not say that that is necessarily so but it is a reasonably plausible conclusion and was what the learned Judges had in mindIt is to be233233 and we can see no justification for giving it less weight than s237s 234, 235) 236 and 239 is just as mandatory as the portion that requires a separate charge for each offenceIt is unfortunate that we have no definition of the terms illegality, irregularity and in-validity because they can be used in differing senses, but however that may be, the decision we are now examining and the remarks made in that case must be read in the light of this backgroundWe agree that some of the expressions used in the judgment appear to travel wider than this but in order to dispel misconception we would now hold that the true view is the one we have propounded at length in the, present judgment41We now turn to the question of fact: is there material in this case to justify a finding of prejudice?221(4), (3) particulars of the time, s222(1) and (4) of the place, s223He is not entitled to any further information in the charge: see Illustration (e) to s223 of the Code: 42He is not entitled to know from the charge simpliciter any further circumstanceHow then is he expected to defend himself?He has the police challan, he has the evidence recorded in the Committal Court, he hears the prosecution witnesses and he is examined u/sIt is these proceedings that furnish him with all the necessary, and indeed vital, information, and it is his duty to look into them and defend himselfIt will be seen that if the logic of the appellants contention is carried to its fullest extent the accused could complain of prejudice because be was not told in the charge whether a pistol was used for the crime or a sword and if a pistol, its calibre and bore and the type of cartridge43Now when several persons join in the commission of a crime and share a common intention, it means that each has the requisite intention in himself the fact that others share it does not absolve any one of them individually, and when the crime is actually committed in pursuance of the common intention and the accused is present at its commission, the crime becomes the offence actually committed because of s34s enunciate a principle of criminal liability44Now what are those legal conditions?It also means that he is informed that it is immaterial who struck the fatal blow4546Put at its highest, all that the appellant can urge is that a charge in the alternative ought to have been framed, which in itself imports that it could have been so framedAs was said by the Privy Counsel in Begu vKing-Emperor [1925] ILR 6 Lah226, 231 1925 Indlaw PC 23 and also by this Court in Lachman Singh vThat is what happened here47The variation between murder and concealing evidence after the crime is no more than the variation between killing a man jointly with another, sharing his intention, or allowing the other to do the actual killing with the same common intentionThe police charge-sheet states that the appellant hit the deceased with a hockey stick while his brother only threw stonesNo one could misunderstand thatNo witness suggests that anyone else hit the deceased on the headThere was no pos- sibility of misunderstanding or mistakeThe fact that the appellant did not attempt to confront any of the witnesses with their statements before either the Committing Magistrate or the police on this point shows that the witnesses told a consistent story from the startHe was told clearly and unambiguously that the evidence was that he hit the deceased over the head48Now what was his defence?A curious procedure was adopted, a procedure that has been condemned by the Nagpur High Court in other cases and which we regret to see still persistsInstead of the accused speaking for himself he made a statement through his advocateHowever, the defence was this: (1) an alibi: I wasnt there(2) It was dark and the deceased rushed at the appellant (who is now said to have been there despite the alibi), fell down the stairs and broke his head (3) The deceased was the aggressor and the appellant struck him in self defence49Next, what was the cross-examination of the only eye-witness?There was no suggestion that she was mistaken in her identity, whereas she was cross examined about this very matter of self defence and questions were put to show that the deceased and not his brother had threatened the appellant with his fist50In the High Court the plea of alibi was dropped and the only argument advanced was self defenceThere was no hint of prejudice even in the grounds of appealOn the contrary, there was a clear admission in the High Court that he did hit the man but that he acted in self defenceAs the Privy Council said in Atta Mohammad vEmperor [1929] LR 57 IA 71, 74 He appeared by an advocate on the appeal and had been legally defended at the trial, and it is as clear as possible that, with full knowledge of the course which the trial had taken, neither the appellant himself nor those who represented him bad any sense whatever of the injustice that is now urged or any idea of his having been deprived of the opportunity of knowing the charge on which he was tried or of raising defences appropriate to that charge51The injury was inflicted with a hockey stickThe head was fractured but the deceased lived for ten daysThe doctor says- I consider the head injury on the head of Smythe was of a very serious nature and was likely to result in fatal consequencesTherefore, the doctor in whose care the patient was till he died places the injury no higher than likely to cause death52The doctor thought that it was only likely to cause deathThe appellant is only 22 years old and not a doctor and can hardly be presumed to have bad this special knowledge at the time he struck the blowAll blows on the head do not necessarily cause death, and as the deceased lived for ten days, we are unable to deduce from the nature of the injury and from the mere fact of death that the appellant had, or should have had, the special knowledge that sAdmittedly, there was no premeditation and there was a sudden fight, so we are unable to ascribe the necessary knowledge to the appellant nor was the injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death53On the question of sentenceThere was no enmity according to the finding of the learned Sessions JudgeThe appellant did not go there armed with a stickHe was in love with the deceaseds sister who reciprocated his affection but could not marry him be-cause her husband had turned her out in England ,and she had no divorceThe deceased, who was the girls brother, resented thisThe appellant went to the house and asked the sister to come downThe brother came instead and there was a quarrelThe appellant slapped the deceased across the faceThe deceased, who was a big and strong man, shook his fist in the appellants face and the appellant snatched a hockey stick from his younger brother Ronnie and hit the deceased one blow over the bead and two blows on the hipsIn the circumstances, we think five years rigorous imprisonment will sufficeCHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J 54The State of Punjab [1955] 1 SC R 1201 1955 Indlaw SC 66 and Suraj Pal vThe State of U P [1955] 1 SCR 1332 1955 Indlaw SC 655This was the line of reasoning in Nanak Chands caseIn Suraj Pals case, the same line is taken but the absence of a specific charge is treated as a serious lacuna merely and not regarded as an illegality56Ronnie was acquittedBut William was found guilty and sentenced to transportation for lifeAs pointed out by Lord Sumner in his classic judgment in Barendra Kumar Ghosh vThe King-Emperor [1924] LR 52 IA 40, there is much difference in the scope and applicability of ss34 and 149, though they have some resemblance and are to some extent overlappingare again compared and contrasted in Karnail Singh and another vThe State of Punjab [1954] SCR 904 1954 Indlaw SC 179149 doesIn a charge under section 34, there is active participation in the commission of the criminal act under section 149, the liability arises by reason of the membership of the unlawful assembly with a common object, and there may be no active participation at all in the perpetration or commission of the crimeBut whereas in this case, the appellant has been individually charged with murder and there is proof that his band caused the injury, the fact that his brother was also sought to be made liable owing to the existence of a common intention, is neither here nor there, so far as the legality of the conviction is concerned, as there has been no prejudice by way of failure of justicelengthy arguments addressed to us, to consider the main question arising on the reference34 also stood on the same footingIn our attempt to resolve the conflict, we covered a wide area of ss and decisionsA detailed discussion of all the decisions cited at the Bar is not of much use as it is not possible to gather from a study of those cases anything very decisive by way of any guiding principleBut a few of them, more important than the rest, must be noticed57530The word illegality was used almost for the first time in the judgment of the Privy Council, LR 28 Indian Appeals 257 (familiarly known as Subramania Aiyars case), where they speak of a contravention of s234 of the Code, resulting in a misjoinder of charges, as an illegalityThe idea that it was a mere irregularity was repelled in these words:- Their Lordships are unable to regard the disobedience to an express provision as to a mode of trial as a mere irregularitySuch a phrase as irregularity is not appropriate to the illegality of trying an accused person for many different offences at the same time, and those offences being spread over a longer period than by law could have been joined together in one indictmentitself sufficiently shows what was meantAgain, they say:- It would be an extraordinary extension of such a branch of administering the criminal law to say that when the Code positively enacts that such a trial as that which has taken place here shall not be permitted that this contravention of the Code comes within the description of error, omission, or irregularity58Subsequently, however, there have been systematic attempts to explain away the said decision and restrict its scope to narrow limitsIn passing, it may be mentioned here that the legislature has now specifically included misjoinder of charges in sub- cl537In Abdul Rahman v53716259227602376153762227)g6364656667304300697053571727374\n"}

overdrafts to be guaranteed by other ChettiarsIf a Chettiar refused to accommodate another moneylender in this way, he would not be able to obtain a guarantor for his own essential borrowings10There were thus elements of mutuality and the essential ingredient in the carrying on of the money lending business, which were elements of the custom proved in that case, both of which are wanting in the present case before us16,200 out of which the assessee took a sum of Rs10,450 for his business needs and L took the balanceThe joint borrowing was necessitated by the business needs of both the borrowers and by the insistence of money lenders, who required the joint security of the two personsL failed in his business and the assessee had to repay the creditors the whole of the joint borrowing658 in an unsuccessful attempt to recover the amount due from L The assessee Claimed to deduct the sum of Rs520495 which he had to pay the creditors on account of Ls share of the joint loan in the computation of his business profitsIt was held that the assessee was not entitled to deduct these sums in the computation of his business profit either under sec tion 10 (2) (xi) or s10 (2) (xv) or as business lossThis case furnishes the proper analogy to the present case and points to the right conclusion in regard to the claim of the appellant11The following passage from the judgment of the learned C J under appeal correctly sums up, in our opinion, the whole position: The debt must therefore be one which can properly be called a trading debt and a debt of the trade, the profits of which are being computedJudged by that test, it is difficult to see how The debt in the present case can be said to be a debt in respect of the business of the assesseeNor is he a money-lenderHe is simply a timber-merchantBut it is not established, nor does it seem to have been alleged, that he in his turn was in the habit of standing surety for other persons along with them for the purpose of securing loans for their use and benefitEven if such, had been the case, any loss suffered by reason of having to pay a debt borrowed for the benefit of another, would have been a capital loss to him and not a business loss at allThe result, therefore, is that the appeal fails and must stand dismissed with costsAppeal dismissed\n"}

H Bhagwati, J 123 of the Act for reinstatement2The respondents are 76 employees of the appellant, a limited company of Sugar Mills, situated in village Chitauni in the district of Deoria and were working in the engineering department of the mills in the mill house, boiling-house and the workshop sectionseIt appears that one Motilal Singh, an employee of the appellant, had been dismissed by it sometime prior thereto and he had been inciting the workmen to make common cause with him, and, at a meeting held the previous night, some sort of action had been decided uponas they should have doneThe sectional engineers incharge asked these workmen as to why they did not commence their work and became aware of their intention to resort to a tools down strikeThey reported the fact to the Chief Engineer who sent a slip to the General Manager informing him that the workers had gone on a tools down strikeThe General Manager thereupon personally went to the workshop, mill house and the boiling house and asked these workmen not to resort to such strike but the latter did not pay any heed to his adviceand report to him if, in spite of his persuasions, they did not commence workthat day3The order for suspension was communicated to these workmen through their sectional heads and was also pasted on the notice board of the millsThere was a recess between 11 aand 1 pand when the gates were opened at 1 pthese 76 workmen, in spite of the warnings of the gatekeepers and Jemadar to the contrary, rushed into the mills, entered their respective sections and adopted a threatening attitudeThe situation which was created by these workmen by forcibly entering their respective sections and continuing there threatening violence was explosive and the management had to call in the police in order to avert violence and damage to the propertyThe police came in at 5 pand order appears to have been restoredThere was no untoward incident that day but the management appears to have viewed the situation with, seriousness and approached the Regional Conciliation Officer the next day in order to ask for advice in regard to the dismissal of these workmenThe workmen, on the other hand, got a letter dated May 28, 1952, addressed to the General Manager by the General Secretary of the Chini Mill Mazdoor Sangh to the effect that they had gone to the gates of the mills as usual at 7 athat day to attend to their work but they were not allowed to enter the mill premisesThey charged the management with the intention to victimise them on the charge of a tools down strike and stated that they had neither struck nor intended to strike but had been prevented from attending to their work and had therefore been advised to go back to their quarters with a view to maintain peaceThe last paragraph of that letter was very significant4The management evidently continued the police precautions and, after having waited for some time, the General Manager furnished to these 76 workmen on June 2, 1952, a charge sheet wherein he charged them with having committed misconduct within the meaning of clL I (a) and (b) and wilful insubordination within the meaning of elL I (a), (b) and (w) of the Standing OrdersHe called upon them to show cause within 24 hours of the receipt of the charge sheet why disciplinary action should not be taken against them and gave them intimation that an open enquiry in connection with the said charges would be held by him at 8 a5The workmen addressed uniform letters to the General Manager denying that there was any tools down strike on May 27, 1952, and alleging that the sectional heads and the Chief Engineer bad conspired together under some mysterious preconceived plans and stated that no useful purpose would be served by holding an enquiry on the 11th day of their suspensionThey pointed out that such indefinite period of suspension during the pendency of the appeal before the Labour Appellate Tribunal and Reconciliation Board was illegal and unjustified and was in utter disregard of the Standing OrdersBy their further letter dated June 5, 1952, similarly addressed to the General Manager, they voiced their apprehension that they would not get any justice from an enquiry held by the management itself and asked for investigation by an impartial tribunal6same and had not appeared at the appointed time and place for the enquiry into the tools-down strikethat day and they replied through the General Secretary of the Chini Mill Mazdoor Sangh repeating that a demand had been made for an investigation by an impartial tribunal and in so far as no impartial tribunal had been appointed they were not agreeable to present themselves and submit their defence at the enquiry which was conducted by the management itself7In the affidavit which was filed in support of that application, all the facts herein before mentioned were set out in extenso and it was pointed out that the management, after giving full consideration to the explanations and offering every possible opportunity to these workmen to explain their conduct coupled with the unreasonable attitude adopted by them, had adjudged them guilty of misconduct under cl8The workmen, in their turn, filed on June 9, 1952, an application under s22(b) of the Act by inflicting on them the punishment in the shape of harassment by resorting to an illegal lookout for an indefinite period with effect from May 27, 1952, without obtaining the prior permission of the , Labour Appellate Tribunal and thereby acting contrary to law and resorting to mala fide actions in direct violation of the provisions of the Standing Orders in continuation of the managements anti trade (Union) activities9Counter affidavits were made by the workmen as also the management in reply to both the above applications22(b) of the ActIt accordingly ordered the reinstatement of the workmen if they presented themselves at the office of the General Manager during office hours on any day within 15 days of the order and also ordered payment of half the salary and allowances for the period of non payment, viz, from the date of their suspension up to the date on which they were taken back in service10Civil Appeal No23 of the Act may be disposed of at once22(b) of the ActThis conclusion of the Labour Appellate Tribunal was, in our opinion, based on a misapprehension of the whole positionThe position had been summed up by the Labour Appellate Tribunal in the following words:- As a matter of fact the management never thought of a lockoutTheir idea was to suspend the suspected persons pending enquiry for which they gave a notice11It observed- We have got a number of affidavits in support of the parties case and there is oath against oathWe do not find ourselves in a position to hold definitely as to what was the exact situationBut it does appear to us that a mountain has been made of a mole hill and conclusions have been arrived at without going deep into the matter12Even if the parties had made a mountain of a mole hill and had reached conclusions without going deep into the matter, it was certainly the business of the Labour Appellate Tribunal itself to record a finding of fact in regard to the situation as it obtained on that daybut their having entered the same threatening violenceA faint attempt was made to charge the section engineers and the Chief Engineer with having conspired under some mysterious preconceived plans but the same rested merely on a bare allegation and was not substantiated by any tangible evidenceon the morning of May 27, 1952, that they were suspended till further orders immediately after the receipt by the General Manager of the first series of reports from the section engineers, that they were prevented from entering the premises at I pbut entered the same threatening violenceIf this is the true position it follows that there was no lockout declared by the appellant, much less an illegal lockout24(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, be deemed to be illegalClive Jute Mills, [1951] II LLJ 344, in which the same question had been considered with reference to sIn that case, a lockout had been declared which involved 4,000 workers of the company and a preliminary contention was urged that there was no contravention of the provisions of sIt did not also amount to punishment, for punishment presupposes an offence or misconductA lockout is generally adopted as a security measure and may in certain cases be used as a weapon corresponding to what the employees have in the shape of a strike and that, therefore, a33(b) would not be contravened by the company by1333(a)It was of opinion that no automatic termination of the services of the employees was brought about by a lockout and the question was whether any of the conditions of service was altered thereby to their prejudiceThe contention of the Union was that the conditions of service were altered to the prejudice of the workmen because those employees did, not in fact get their pay during the period of the lockout with the possibility of losing it33(a), the questioned act of the employer must directly and in fact alter the conditions of service to the prejudice of the workmen concerned, that is to say, the moment the lockout was declaredS 33(a) would not, therefore, be attracted by the mere fact of a lockout33(b) would be contravened by the company in declaring the lockout14This decision of the LabourAppellate Tribunal was followed in Colliery Mazdoor Congress, Asansol, vNew Beerbhoom Coal Co Ltd, [1952] L AC 219 and the Labour Appellate Tribunal there held that a lockout did not come within the ambit of s15If the lockout is legal, no question can at all ariseIf, on the other hand,, the lockout is illegal, a remedy is provided in s26 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947The employees affected by a lock out would in any event be entitled to refer the industrial dispute arising between themselves and the employer for adjudication by adopting the proper procedure in regard thereto16Civil Appeal No17Coming now to Civil Appeal No244 of 1954, the first question to determine is whether the respondents had resorted to an illegal strikeThe fact that the strike was of a short duration viztill 10-30 awould not exculpate the respondents from the consequence of having resorted to such illegal strike, the avowed intention of the strikers being not to resume work until their pre concerted plan conceived at, the meeting held on the previous night was carried outand the management, having failed in its attempts to persuade the workmen to resume their work was well within its rights to suspend these workmen pending further orders(Vide Buckingham and Carnatic Co Ltd vWorkers of the Buckingham and Carnatic Co Ltd, [1953] SCR 219 1952 Indlaw SC 12)18L 12 of the Standing Orders as determinative of the whole enquiry before it observing that although the delay (in holding the enquiry) was not unreasonable, there was no doubt that the management did violate the letter of the ruleIt further observed that there was no sufficient reason indicated for extending the period of suspension beyond the period of four days provided in clL 12 of the Standing Orders, the tension created by the non co-operation of the workers not having been considered sufficient to preclude the management from collecting materials for conducting the enquiry within the said period of 4 days, This reasoning of the Labour Appellate Tribunal was unsoundThe workmen had forcibly entered the premises of the mills in spite of the warnings of the watchmen and the Jemadar and had also entered the workshop, the boiling house and the mill house and continued to stay there threatening violenceThis was enough evidence of their mentality and the management naturally enough apprehended breach of peace at the hands of these workmenIf this was the tense atmosphere created by the non co-operation of the workmen, the management was perfectly justified in postponing the enquiry by a few days and continuing the workmen under sus pensionThe delay which was thus caused in furnishing the charge-sheets and giving notice of the enquiry to these workmen on June 2, 1952, was, therefore, sufficiently explained and if there was any one responsible for this delay it was the workmen and not the managementIt did not then lie in the mouth of the workmen to protest against this delay in the enquiry and trot out their suspension for a period exceeding four days as an excuse for abstaining from the enquiry22 merely on that ground without making any further enquiry into the circumstances of the case19If full and free opportunity was given to the respondents to present themselves at the enquiry and defend themselves it could not be said that the enquiry was anything but fairNo principles of natural justice were violated and the management was at liberty to come to its own conclusions in regard to the culpability of the respondents and also to determine what punishment should be meted out to the respondents for the misconduct and insubordination proved against themIt was not open to the respondents then, having regard to the attitude which they had adopted throughout in relation to the said enquiry, to urge that the enquiry was not fair or impartial or that the principles of natural justice had been violated by the General Manager of the appellant in the conduct of the enquiry20It was contended that such suspension involved loss of pay by the respondents and being of an indefinite duration inflicted such harassment on them that it could not be deemed to be anything except a punishmentWe do not accept this contentionThere is nothing like a contingent punishment of a workman and therefore such suspension could not be deemed to be a punishment of the workman at allOrders for suspension were meant only as security measures or precautionary ones taken in the interest of the industry itself or its employees in generalThese measures were sometimes called for immediately after an incident and any delay, however small, might defeat the purpose for which such measures were

securing his release by his representation, but whether his Constitutional safeguard has been infringedPreventive detention is a serious invasion of personal liberty and such meager safeguards as the Constitution has provided against the improper exercise of the power must be jealously watched and enforced by the Court We are Of opinion that this Constitutional requirement must be satisfied with

mentioned the petitioners detention cannot be held to be in accordance with the procedure established by law within the meaning of article 215The State of U P 1953 Indlaw SC 42 (supra) is a case where the question arose in a different forme, fell under two different categories, viz, (1) prejudicial to maintenance of supplies essential to community, and (2) injurious to maintenance of public orderTheir Lordships dealt with the matter as follows: It has been repeatedly held by this court that the power to issue a detention order under section 3 of the Preventive Detention Act depends entirely upon the satisfaction of the appropriate authority specified in that sectionThe sufficiency Of the grounds upon which such satisfaction purports to be based, provided they have a rational probative value and are not extraneous to the scope or purpose of the legislative provision cannot be challenged in a court of law, except on the ground of mala fides6Posing the situation which arises in such cases where one of the grounds is found to be irrelevant or unsubstantiated, the Court stated as follows: The question is, whether in such circumstances the original order made under section 3(1)(a) of the Act can be allowed to standThe answer, in our opinion, can only be in the negativeWe can neither decide whether these grounds are good or bad nor can we attempt to assess in what manner and to what extent each of these grounds operated on the mind of the appropriate authority and contributed to the creation of the satisfaction on the basis of which the detention order was madeTo say that the other ground, which still remains, is quite sufficient to sustain the order, would be to substitute an objective judicial test for the subjective decision of the executive authority which is

based on a Dumber of grounds or for a variety of reasons all taken together, and if some out of them are found to be nonexistent or irrelevant, the very exercise of that power is badThat is so, because the matter being one for subjective satisfaction, it must be properly based, on all the reasons on which it purports to be basedIf some ,out of them are found to be nonexistent or irrelevant, the Court cannot predicate what the subjective satisfaction of the said authority would have been on the exclusion of those grounds or reasonsIn applying these principles, however, the Court must be

Krishna Chettiar vManikkammal 1933 Indlaw MAD 146 that the Act did not apply to cases of Hindu males who had died intestate before the Act came into forceThis decision was given on the 19th October 1933, that is to say, just ten days before the death of Ranganayaki8He appears to have taken legal advice on the question whether he or Padmasani, as the sister of the propositus, would have a preferential claim to the inheritance9He approached his brothers son Krishnaswami, an advocate practicing at Kumbakonam, who was working as a junior to a well known lawyer, Rao Bahadur N Thiruvengadatha Iyengar, who appears to have been a very prominent citizen of the district, besides being a leading lawyer of the place10The advocate Krishnaswami aforesaid was related to his senior as the former had married the latters brothers daughterRao Bahadur Thiruvengadatha Iyengar had an elder brother named N Srinivasa Iyengar (DW I) , who appears to have been a prominent and influential inhabitant of the locality1112Doraiswami was sent for by D W I and was told that Padmasani would have to go to court if the parties to the dispute did not settle it out of Court131415Padmasanis husband Rajagopal was financially in embarrassed position and had incurred debts on the occasion of his daughters marriage, as also for the maintenance and education of his children, with the result that some decrees had been obtained against him and his own properties were in jeopardy16In the documents as finally prepared the minor sons were represented by their mother as guardian in preference of their father Rajagopal, who should under the law have been the preferential guardianThis was done with a view to avoiding complications and in fear of the creditors of Rajagopal, though really it was the father who had carried on the negotiations and finalized the agreement1720 acres of wet land and 422 acres of dry land18It proceeded on the basis that the entire properties mentioned in schedules A, B and C to the deed were inherited by Doraiswami from the propositus and that the second party had no legal claim thereto but that out of love and affection for his deceased brothers daughter and daughters sons he was making provision for their maintenance1920But on the 29th January 1937 a Full Bench of the Madras High Court  overruled the earlier decision and on the 31st January 1937 a notice (ExD-2) was issued on behalf of the plaintiffs impugning the transaction evidence by Ex D-1 aforesaid* Reported as, 1937 Indlaw MAD 320 2122Padmasanis consent to the document was also assailed on the ground that she was not the legal guardian of the plaintiffs and had in interest adverse to theirsDefendants 2 to 27 were impleaded as alieness from the 1st defendant and defendants 28to 39 and 41 as alieness from Ranganayaki and Padmasani2324That transaction was reduced to the form of a document (ExD-1) It was also averred that the plaintiffs fathers family was financially in difficult circumstances and that the arrangement was considered by all the parties concerned as highly beneficial to the plaintiffs themselvesThe allegations of undue influence and exercise of pressure of Padmasani were denied25It recorded certain compromises in respect of disputes between the plaintiffs & some of the alieneesThe Court found that the allegations of undue influence & coercion & that Padmasani and her husband Rajagopal were duped had been recklessly made and had no foundation even in the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs; that the family arrangement had been arrived at on a bona fide settlement of a genuine dispute between the relations at the intervention of competent lawyers and good friends who were actuated solely by considerations of benefit to the familyIts conclusions can be summed up in its own words as follows : - So there were clearly rival claims, and a real family dispute, and a bona fide settlement thereof by respectable mediators, acting on the best of their lights and interested in both parties, and making a bona fide settlement of the dispute with the consent of both sides, and their active participation in bringing about the result (by arranging the transaction with Mr Natesa Ayyar), and both parties subsequently recognized, Ex27P-1The law was laid down by Romilly, M R in -Lawton vChampion, in these words : -

Krishna Chettiar vManikkammal 1933 Indlaw MAD 146 that the Act did not apply to cases of Hindu males who had died intestate before the Act came into forceThis decision was given on the 19th October 1933, that is to say, just ten days before the death of Ranganayaki8He appears to have taken legal advice on the question whether he or Padmasani, as the sister of the propositus, would have a preferential claim to the inheritance9He approached his brothers son Krishnaswami, an advocate practicing at Kumbakonam, who was working as a junior to a well known lawyer, Rao Bahadur N Thiruvengadatha Iyengar, who appears to have been a very prominent citizen of the district, besides being a leading lawyer of the place10The advocate Krishnaswami aforesaid was related to his senior as the former had married the latters brothers daughterRao Bahadur Thiruvengadatha Iyengar had an elder brother named N Srinivasa Iyengar (DW I) , who appears to have been a prominent and influential inhabitant of the locality1112Doraiswami was sent for by D W I and was told that Padmasani would have to go to court if the parties to the dispute did not settle it out of Court131415Padmasanis husband Rajagopal was financially in embarrassed position and had incurred debts on the occasion of his daughters marriage, as also for the maintenance and education of his children, with the result that some decrees had been obtained against him and his own properties were in jeopardy16In the documents as finally prepared the minor sons were represented by their mother as guardian in preference of their father Rajagopal, who should under the law have been the preferential guardianThis was done with a view to avoiding complications and in fear of the creditors of Rajagopal, though really it was the father who had carried on the negotiations and finalized the agreement1720 acres of wet land and 422 acres of dry land18It proceeded on the basis that the entire properties mentioned in schedules A, B and C to the deed were inherited by Doraiswami from the propositus and that the second party had no legal claim thereto but that out of love and affection for his deceased brothers daughter and daughters sons he was making provision for their maintenance1920But on the 29th January 1937 a Full Bench of the Madras High Court  overruled the earlier decision and on the 31st January 1937 a notice (ExD-2) was issued on behalf of the plaintiffs impugning the transaction evidence by Ex D-1 aforesaid* Reported as, 1937 Indlaw MAD 320 2122Padmasanis consent to the document was also assailed on the ground that she was not the legal guardian of the plaintiffs and had in interest adverse to theirsDefendants 2 to 27 were impleaded as alieness from the 1st defendant and defendants 28to 39 and 41 as alieness from Ranganayaki and Padmasani2324That transaction was reduced to the form of a document (ExD-1) It was also averred that the plaintiffs fathers family was financially in difficult circumstances and that the arrangement was considered by all the parties concerned as highly beneficial to the plaintiffs themselvesThe allegations of undue influence and exercise of pressure of Padmasani were denied25It recorded certain compromises in respect of disputes between the plaintiffs & some of the alieneesThe Court found that the allegations of undue influence & coercion & that Padmasani and her husband Rajagopal were duped had been recklessly made and had no foundation even in the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs that the family arrangement had been arrived at on a bona fide settlement of a genuine dispute between the relations at the intervention of competent lawyers and good friends who were actuated solely by considerations of benefit to the familyIts conclusions can be summed up in its own words as follows : - So there were clearly rival claims, and a real family dispute, and a bona fide settlement thereof by respectable mediators, acting on the best of their lights and interested in both parties, and making a bona fide settlement of the dispute with the consent of both sides, and their active participation in bringing about the result (by arranging the transaction with Mr Natesa Ayyar), and both parties subsequently recognized, Ex27P-1The law was laid down by Romilly, M R in -Lawton vChampion, in these words : -

sometime in 1953The defence plea was that in the years 1954, 1955, 1956 possession was shown as that of BanwariBut if there were any such entries, they were corrected in 1956 and possession was shown in the revenue papers as that of Rameshwar, and four others abovenamedThese entries showing cultivating possession of the deceased and four others were continued in 1957On April 18, 1957, Banwari sold

properties details whereof are not necessary for our purposeThis suit was numbered Title Suit 16 of 1944 in the court of the Subordinate Judge of SambalpurThe claim of the plaintiffs, now respondents before us, was founded on the following pedigree:- 3The last male owner was Satyananda who died unmarried sometime in 1902-1903, and his mother Haripriya succeeded to the estateShe lived till 1942; but in 1916 she had sold a portion of the property to one Indumati, daughter of Dharanidhar Misra (plaintiffs witness no4) and some of the reversioners, namely, Natabar and Janardan, who were agnates of Haripriyas husband Lokenath Parichha, brought a suit challenging the alienation31 of 1917 in the court of the Subordinate Judge, SambalpurThe suit was decreed on August 31, 1918, and the alienation was declared to be without legal necessity and not binding on the reversion after the death of HaripriyaIn 1929 was passed the Hindu Law of Inheritance (Amendment) Act (II of 1929) which inter alia gave to a sisters son a place in the order of Mitakshara succession higher than the agnates; before the amending Act a sisters son ranked as a bandhu, but under it he succeeded next after the sisterThe question whether a half-sister was entitled to get the benefit of the amending Act gave rise to a difference of opinion, but the Privy Council held in 1942, settling the difference then existing between the various High Courts, that the term I sister included a half-sister; but a full sister and a half-sister did not take together and the latter took only in default of the full sister(See MstSahodra vRam Babu, (1942) LR 69 IA 145 1942 Indlaw PC 10)The plaintiffs-respondents claimed on the strength of the pedigree which they set up that they were sons of the half-sister of Satyanand and therefore came before the agnates4The suit was contested by some of the defendants who were agnates of Lokenath Paricha and of whom the present appellant was oneThe contesting defendants challenged the correctness of the pedigree alleged by the plaintiffs-respondents and their main case was that Ahalya and Malabati were not the daughters of Lokenath Parichha but were daughters of Baidyanath Misra, father of HaripriyaThe relevant pedigree which the appellant set up was- 5As the High Court has put it, the essential controversy between the parties centred round the question if the plaintiffs-respondents were the sons of the daughters of Lokenath Parichha by his first wife SatyabhamaOn this question the parties gave both oral and documentary evidenceOn a consideration of that evidence the learned Subordinate Judge held that they were the sons of the daughters of Lokenath Parichha and on that finding the suit was decreedThere was an appeal to the High Court, and it affirmed the finding Of the learned Subordinate JudgeThe High Court relied on Ex1, a petition dated November 2, 1917, which Satyabadi on his own behalf and on behalf of his brothers Baikunth Pati and Dasarath Pati had filed in Suit No31 of 1917; this petition contained a pedigree which showed that Ahalya, Brindabati, and Malabati were daughters of Lokenath Parichha by his first wife and Satyabadi, Baikunth and Dasarath were the sons of AhalyaThe admissibility of this document was challenged on behalf of the appellant, but the learned Judges of the High Court held that the document was admissible under s32(5) of the Evidence ActThe contention before us is that the document was not so admissible, and this is one of the questions for decision before us6As to the oral evidence, Narasimham, J, held that the testimony given by three of the witnesses of the plaintiffs-respondents, namely, Janardan Misra (plaintiffs witness no2), Sushila Misrain (plaintiffs witness no3) and Dharanidhar Misra (plaintiffs witness no4)was admissible under s50 of the Evidence Act, and he relied on that testimony in support of the pedigree set up by the plaintiffs-respondentsThe learned Chief Justice relied on the evidence of Dharanidbar Misra which be held to be admissible but with regard to the other two witnesses, he said- With regard to the other two witnesses relied on by the plaintiffs namely that of P Ws2 (Janardan Misra, aged 62) and 3 (Susila Misrani, aged 43) knowledge of relevant facts as to relationships can seldom be attributed to themTheir evidence, though true, and otherwise acceptable, must be based upon their having heard the declarations of such members of the family as were their contemporaries or upon the tradition or reputation as to family descent handed down from generation to generation and recognised and adopted by the family generallyThis may partly, if not wholly, be based upon conduct within the meaning of section 50, such as treating and recognising the mothers of the plaintiffs as Lokenaths daughters, and the plaintiffs as his daughters sonsThey, judged from their respective ages, could not be considered to have direct knowledge of the matters in issueScanning their evidence closely, I find that they have in no way deposed about such conduct of the members of the family of Lokenatb as could be attributed to the knowledge or belief or consciousness of those who had special means of knowledge of the relationships or that the relationship was recognised and adopted by the family generallyIn the circumstances, I entertain some doubt as to the acceptability of their statements in evidence7On behalf of the appellant, it has been contended that the testimony of none of the aforesaid three witnesses fell within the purview of s50 of the Evidence Act and the High Court was in error in admitting and accepting that evidence or any part thereof, and according to learned counsel for the appellant, the whole of it was hearsay pure and simple-some of it being even second or third-hand hearsayThus the second question for our consideration is if the testimony of the witnesses mentioned above or of any of them, is admissible evidence within the meaning of s50 of the Evidence Act8We proceed to consider the second question firstThe Evidence Act states that the expression facts in issue means and includes any fact from which either by itself or in connection with other facts the existence, non-existence, nature or extent of any right, liability or disability asserted or denied in any suit or proceeding necessarily follow; evidence means and includes (1) all statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses in relation to matters of fact under enquiry ; and (2) all documents produced for the inspection of the CourtIt further states that one fact is said to be relevant to another when the one is connected with the other in any one of the ways referred to in the provisions of the Evidence Act relating to the relevancy of factsS 5 of the Evidence Act lays down that evidence may be given in any suit or proceeding of the existence or non-existence of every fact in issue and of such other facts as are declared to be relevant and of no othersIt is in the context of these provisions of the Evidence Act that we have to consider s50 which occurs in Chapter 11, headed Of the Relevancy of Facts Section 50, in so far as it is relevant for our purpose, is in these terms:- S50When the Court has to form an opinion as to the relationship of one person to another, the opinion, expressed by conduct, as to the existence of such relationship, of any person who, as a member of the family or otherwise, has special means of knowledge on the subject, is a relevant factOn a plain reading of the section it is quite clear that it deals with relevancy of a particular factIt states in effect that when the Court has to form an opinion as to the relationship of one person to another the opinion expressed by conduct as to the existence of such relationship of any person who has special means of knowledge on the subject of that relationship is a relevant factThe two illustrations appended to the section clearly bring out the true scope and effect of the sectionIt appears to us that the essential requirements of the section are-(1) there, must be a case where the court has to form an opinion as to the relationship of one person to another; (2) in such a,case, the opinion expressed by conduct as to the existence of such relationship is a relevant fact; (3)but the person whose opinion expressed by conduct is relevant must be a, person who as a member of the family or otherwise has special means of knowledge on the particular subject of relationship ; in other words,the person must fulfil the condition laid down in the latter part of the sectionIf the person fulfils that condition, then what is relevant is his opinion expressed by conductOpinion means something more than more retailing of gossip or of hearsay; it means judgment or belief, that is, a belief or a conviction resulting from what one thinks on a particular questionNow, the belief or conviction may manifest itself in conduct or behaviour which indicates the existence of the belief or opinionWhat the section says is that such conduct or outward behaviour as evidence of the opinion held is relevant and may, therefore, be provedWe are of the view that the true scope and effect of s50 of the Evidence Act has been correctly and succinctly put in the following observations made in Chandu Lal Agarwala vKhalilar Rahman, ILR [1942] 2 Cal299, 309:- It is only opinion as expressed by conduct which is made relevantThis is how the conduct comes inThe offered item of evidence is the conduct, but what is made admissible in evidence is the opinion, the opinion as expressed by such conduct) The offered item of evidence thus only moves the Court to an intermediate decision: its immediate effect is only to move the Court to see if this conduct establishes any I opinion of the person, whose conduct is in evidence, as to the relationship in questionIn order to enable the Court to infer the opinion , the conduct must be of a tenor which cannot well be supposed to have been willed without the inner existence of the I opinion9When the conduct is of such a tenor, the Court only gets to a relevant piece of evidence, namely, the opinion of a personIt still remains for the Court to weigh such evidence and come to its own opinion as to the factum probandum as to the relationship in questionWe also accept as correct the view that s50 does not make evidence of mere general reputation (without conduct) admissible as proof of relationship: Lakshmi Reddi vVenkata Reddi, AIR 1937 PC 201 1937 Indlaw PC 6010It is necessary to state here that how the conduct or external behaviour which expresses the opinion of a person coming within the meaning of s50 is to be proved is not stated in the sectionThe section merely says that such opinion is a relevant fact on the subject of relationship of one person to another in a case where the court has to form an opinion as to that relationshipPart 11 of the Evidence Act is headed On ProofChapter III thereof contains a fascicule of sections relating to facts which need not be provedThen there is Chapter IV dealing with oral evidence and in it occurss60 which says inter alia:- S60Oral evidence must, in all cases whatever, be direct that is to say- 10If it refers to a fact which could be seen, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he saw it; if it refers to a fact which could be heard, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he heard it; if it refers to a fact which could be perceived by any other sense or in any other manner, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he perceived it by that sense in that manner; if it refers to an opinion or to the grounds on which that opinion is held, it must be the evidence of the person who holds that opinion on those groundsIf we remember that the offered item of evidence under s50 is conduct in the sense explained above, then there is no difficulty in holding that such conduct or outward behaviour must be proved in the manner laid down in sThe conduct must be of the person who fulfils the essential conditions of sIt appears to us that that portion of s60In Queen Empress v12131415165050171819132(2)(3)(4)(6)(7)(8)20212223242526272812930", "Summary1000": "Dolgobinda Paricha v Nimai Charan Misra, and Others Supreme Court of India  27 April 1959 CA

12Sometime in the middle of March, 1953, one Shri Bhan, a representative of a Calcutta firm styled MessrsGattulal Chhaganlal Joshi, came to Delhi with a view to get the name of the firm removed from black list in which it had been placed, and for that purpose, he was contacting the officers in the DepartmentHe immediately reported the matter to the Special Police Establishment, and they decided to lay a trap for him3allega- tions relating to meetings between the respondent and Sri Tawakley on March 17, 1953, on March 21, 1953, a telephonic conversation with reference to the same matter later on that day, and the meeting in the Kwality Restaurant already mentionedThe respondent was called upon to give his explanation to the charges, and he was directed to state whether he wished to lead oral or documentary evidence in defenceThe enquiry was delegated to Mt4On July 28, 1953, Mr Byrne submitted his report, and there in, he found that the charges against the respondent had been clearly establishedOn this, a communication was issued to the respondent on August 29, 1953, wherein he was informed that it was provisionally decided that he should be dismissed, and asked to show cause against the proposed actionAlong with the notice, the whole of the report of Mr Byrne, omitting his recommendations, was sent5320 , and it sent its report on September 6, 1954, that the charges were made out, that there was no substance in the complaint of the respondent that he was not allowed to cross-examine the witnesses, and that he should be dismissedThe Presidentaccepting the finding of the Enquiring Officer and the recommendation of the Union Public Service Commission, made an order on September 16, 1954, thatthe respondent should be dismissed from Government service6311 (2)In the result, they set aside the order, and directed him to be reinstatedThe correctness of this order is challenged by the Solicitor- General on two grounds : (1) that the finding that the respondent had no reasonable opportunity afforded to him at the enquiry is not supported by the evidence; and (2) that even if there was a defect in the enquiry, that was a matter that could be set right in the stage following the show-cause-notice, and as the respondent did not ask for an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses, he could not be heard to urge that the order dated September 16, 1954, was bad as contravening Art311 (2)7Municipal Board, Kairana ([1950] SCR 560),  the existence of an adequate legal remedy is a thing to be taken into consideration in the matter of granting writs Vide also K S Rashid and Son vThe Income-tax Investigation Commission [1954] SCR 738, 747 1954 Indlaw SC 20And where such remedy exists, it will be a sound exercise of discretion to refuse to interfere in a petition under Art226, unless there are good grounds there forNone such appears in the present caseAs the High Court has gone into the matter on the merits, we propose to dispose of this appeal on a consideration of the merits8The main ground on which the respondent attacked the order dated September 16, 1954, was that at the enquiry held by Mr Byrne, he was not given an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses, who deposed against him, and that the findings reached at such enquiry could not be acceptedBut the question is, whether that allegation has been made outIn para10On this affidavit, Mr Byrne was examined in Court, and he repeated these allegations and added:  I have distinct recollection that I asked Shri T R Varma to put questions in cross-examination to witnesses11It was elicited in the course of his further examination that he did not make any note that he asked Shri T R Varma to put questions in cross-examination to witnesses, and that that might have been due to a slip on his part12There are more over, features in the record, which clearly show that the statement of Mr Byrne must be correctThe examination of witnesses began on April 20, 1953, and four witnesses were examined on that date, among them being Sri C B Tawakley13If, as stated by the respondent, he asked for permission to cross examine witnesses, and that was refused, it is surprising that he should not have put the complaint in writing on the subsequent dates on which the enquiry was continuedOne is that there was no record made in the depositions of the witnesses that there was no cross-examinationBut what follows from this?That, in fact, there was no cross-examination, which is a fact; not that the request of the respondent to cross-examine was disallowedThen again, the learned Judges say that the respondent was present at the hearing of the writ petition before them, that they put questions to him, and formed the opinion that he was sufficiently intelligent, and that it was difficult to believe that he would not have cross-examined the witnessesWe are of opinion that this was a consideration which ought not to have been taken into account in a judicial determination of the question, and that it should have been wholly excluded15In substance, the charge is that the respondent and his witnesses should have been allowed to give their evidence by way of examination-in-chief, and that only thereafter the officer should have cross-examined them, but that he took upon himself to cross-examine them from the very start and had thereby violated well-recognised rules of procedureThere is also a complaint that the respondent was not allowed to put questions to them16Now, it is no doubt true that the evidence of the respondent and his witnesses was not taken in the mode prescribed in the Evidence Act; but that Act has no application to enquiries conducted by tribunals, even though they may be judicial in character), 1956 Indlaw SC 69 where this question is discussed17We have examined the record in the light of the above principles, and find that there has been no violation of the principles of natural justiceThere will be no order as to

black list in which it had been placed, and for that purpose, he was contacting the officers in the DepartmentHe immediately reported the matter to the Special Police Establishment, and they decided to lay a trap for him3allega- tions relating to meetings between the respondent and Sri Tawakley on March 17, 1953, on March 21, 1953, a telephonic conversation with reference to the same matter later on that day, and the meeting in the Kwality Restaurant already mentionedThe respondent was called upon to give his explanation to the charges, and he was directed to state whether he wished to lead oral or documentary evidence in defenceThe enquiry was delegated to Mt4On July 28, 1953, Mr Byrne submitted his report, and there in, he found that the charges against the respondent had been clearly establishedOn this, a communication was issued to the respondent on August 29, 1953, wherein he was informed that it was provisionally decided that he should be dismissed, and asked to show cause against the proposed actionAlong with the notice, the whole of the report of Mr Byrne, omitting his recommendations, was sent5320 , and it sent its report on September 6, 1954, that the charges were made out, that there was no substance in the complaint of the respondent that he was not allowed to cross-examine the witnesses, and that he should be dismissedThe Presidentaccepting the finding of the Enquiring Officer and the recommendation of the Union Public Service Commission, made an order on September 16, 1954, thatthe respondent should be dismissed from Government service6311 (2)In the result, they set aside the order, and directed him to be reinstatedThe correctness of this order is challenged by the Solicitor- General on two grounds : (1) that the finding that the respondent had no reasonable opportunity afforded to him at the enquiry is not supported by the evidence and (2) that even if there was a defect in the enquiry, that was a matter that could be set right in the stage following the show-cause-notice, and as the respondent did not ask for an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses, he could not be heard to urge that the order dated September 16, 1954, was bad as contravening Art311 (2)7Municipal Board, Kairana ([1950] SCR 560),  the existence of an adequate legal remedy is a thing to be taken into consideration in the matter of granting writs Vide also K S Rashid and Son vThe Income-tax Investigation Commission [1954] SCR 738, 747 1954 Indlaw SC 20And where such remedy exists, it will be a sound exercise of discretion to refuse to interfere in a petition under Art226, unless there are good grounds there forNone such appears in the present caseAs the High Court has gone into the matter on the merits, we propose to dispose of this appeal on a consideration of the merits8The main ground on which the respondent attacked the order dated September 16, 1954, was that at the enquiry held by Mr Byrne, he was not given an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses, who deposed against him, and that the findings reached at such enquiry could not be acceptedBut the question is, whether that allegation has been made outIn para10On this affidavit, Mr Byrne was examined in Court, and he repeated these allegations and added:  I have distinct recollection that I asked Shri T R Varma to put questions in cross-examination to witnesses11It was elicited in the course of his further examination that he did not make any note that he asked Shri T R Varma to put questions in cross-examination to witnesses, and that that might have been due to a slip on his part12There are more over, features in the record, which clearly show that the statement of Mr Byrne must be correctThe examination of witnesses began on April 20, 1953, and four witnesses were examined on that date, among them being Sri C B Tawakley13If, as stated by the respondent, he asked for permission to cross examine witnesses, and that was refused, it is surprising that he should not have put the complaint in writing on the subsequent dates on which the enquiry was continuedOne is that there was no record made in the depositions of the witnesses that there was no cross-examinationBut what follows from this?That, in fact, there was no cross-examination, which is a fact not that the request of the respondent to cross-examine was disallowedThen again, the learned Judges say that the respondent was present at the hearing of the writ petition before them, that they put questions to him, and formed the opinion that he was sufficiently intelligent, and that it was difficult to believe that he would not have cross-examined the witnessesWe are of opinion that this was a consideration which ought not to have been taken into account in a judicial determination of the question, and that it should have been wholly excluded15In substance, the charge is that the respondent and his witnesses should have been allowed to give their evidence by way of examination-in-chief, and that only thereafter the officer should have cross-examined them, but that he took upon himself to cross-examine them from the very start and had thereby violated well-recognised rules of procedureThere is also a complaint that the respondent was not allowed to put questions to them16Now, it is no doubt true that the evidence of the respondent and his witnesses was not taken in the mode prescribed in the Evidence Act but that Act has no application to enquiries conducted by tribunals, even though they may be judicial in character), 1956 Indlaw SC 69 where this question is discussed17We have examined the record in the light of the above principles, and find that there has been no violation of the principles of natural justiceThere will be no order as to costsAppeal allowed\n"}

lying on the western verandah of the bungalow of the Kabristhan with a number of cut injuries on the neck and on other parts of the body3The standard of proof required to convict a person on such

that the circumstances relied upon must be fully established and that the chain of evidence furnished by these circumstances should be so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accusedThe learned counsel for the appellant has, therefore, strenuously contended before us that the circumstances relied on have not been fully

the appellant came out and on seeing the woman told the peon that she was his wife and asked him to make some arrangement to keep her for the day so that he might meet her in the evening after he was free from the office workThe peon accordingly made arrangements for her stay till the evening in the quarters of the Chowkidar, PW 22, who lived in the compound of the officeIn the evening of that day, i5e, 4th September and that leave was grantedThat the appellant did apply for leave and got it is not disputedThis evidence has been strongly challenged6Not only was there the evidence of the peon, PW 12, and the chowkidar, PW 22, in support of the prosecution case as to the date being the 3rd but a responsible and, educated person like the Inspector of Income-tax, against whom nothing has been alleged, has also spoken to the same from his personal knowledgeHis answer,% in that court were bare denials when he was asked whether he saw Parbati Devi at the Patna Incometax Office on the 3rd and whether he asked the chowkidar to allow her to remain in his house for the whole of the dayIn the circumstances, the following facts, vizmThe next important circumstance alleged against him is the existence of a strong motiveThat the relations between both of them were completely strained, and that the marital tie was virtually (though not legally) snapped, is admitted and is clearly borne out on the record by the Thyagpatra which he gave to the Secretary, Anath Ashram, in 1945 authorising him to get her married to an- other personThe suggestion for the prosecution is that in, all these circumstances and having regard to the bad reputation which this woman had gathered round her, as the evidence clearly shows, and in view of the fact that she started troubling him by visits at his office, the appellant had a strong motive to commit the, murder2 (a), a Thyagpatra executed by the appellant on the 12th October, 1945, shows that he purported to give up all -rights over this woman as a husband and authorised the Ashram to arrange to get her married according to her choiceSimultaneously with this Thyagpatra, he also sent a letter to the Secretary, Anath Ashram, Ex2-A(1), which is as follows: It is submitted that I have duly filled the tyagpatra (divorce form) in connection with my wife Parbati Devi and submitted the same to the AshramBesides this, I pray to the Ashram Samiti and the Bibah Samiti, with my folded hands that they should keep in mind to get Parbati Devi married at a very distant place in any other State, because she is Woman of such a loose character that if she is married to a place near about it will bring ill fame to the Ashram and to meAs I am an employee in the Police department, it shall adversely affect my serviceI pray you not to refuse my prayer8But in view of his own admission that she started troubling him again by visiting him at his office, and demanding money at least on two occasions including that on the 3rd September, the courts below were perfectly justified in considering that a strong present motive on the part of the appellant has been made out9Undoubtedly there is some gap in the evidence at this point10It cannot be denied, however, that if the circumstances against the appellant stopped short at this point, there may be room for hesitationThere are however further circumstances relied upon by the courts below and they require to be noticed and considered11These further circumstances are (1) the finding of a blood- stained knife (pen-knife) near the dead body, and (2) the existence of certain injuries upon the person of the appellant when he was arrested on the 6thThe appellant, while in his examination under section 342, Criminal Procedure Code admitted that he used to keep a knife for mending pencil, denied that the knife, produced in court as being the one which was found by the side of the dead body, was his or was like the one he keptIt was strongly urged on behalf of the defence that there was no proof that this was the very knife which the appellant used to haveThe learned Judges of the High Court met this criticism as follows:- Of course no witness could have possibly deposed that this was the knife which was in possession of the appellantIt has a cork screw and a bottle opener-all combined12In view of the above observation by the learned Judges and having regard to the evidence of PW 18, who, though he did not speak of these peculiar features, has categorically said that he had never seen -such a knife before, there is no reason to disagree with the finding of the High Court that the find of this knife near the dead body is a strong circumstance against the appellant13PW 24, a Civil Assistant Surgeon of Gaya who examined him at 6 PmNumbers 1 and 2 might have been caused

indicates that he received the injuries on the band from a piece of glass16234517These circumstances taken together, advance the case against the appellant very much beyond suspicion and reasonably

properties appurtenant to itP XIII of 1936) (hereinafter described as the Act)The declaration, the consequential injunction and the two other subsidiary reliefs are claimed primarily against respondent 1, the Sunni Central Board of Waqf, United Provinces of Agra and OudhTwo trustees who did not join the appellants in filing the suit are impleaded as pro forma defendants 2 and 3 and they are respondents 2 and 3 before us25 of 1946)That is the basis of the reliefs claimed by the appellants in their plaint2The appellants claim was resisted by respondent I on several grounds34In his opinion it was not the village Singha Parasi but its profits free from land revenue that had been granted in trust for the shrine and its khadims; and since the usufruct of the profits was subject to the condition of resumption and since the profits had not been vested in the Almighty, the grant cannot be construed to be a waqf as contemplated by Muhamniadan Law53 of the Act was partly upheld by the learned trial judge; he took the view that the first three relief,-, claimed by the appellants were barred but the fourth was notThe rest of the appellants claim was dismissedThis decree was passed on April 15, 19475Against this decree respondent I preferred an appeal in the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (Lucknow Bench) and the appellants filed cross objectionsAs a result of these findings the appeal preferred by respondent I was allowed, the appellants cross-objections were dismissed, the decree passed by the trial court was set aside and the appellants suit dismissed (April 22, 1953)133 of the Constitution6Though the dispute between the parties raises only three principal issues, the facts leading to the litigation are somewhat complicated ; and it is necessary to mention them in order to get a clear picture of the background of the present disputeIt is believed that Syed Salar Mahsood Ghazi was a nephew of Muhammad Ghazni and he met his death at the hands of a local chieftain when he paid a visit to BahraichOn his death his remains were buried in village Singha Parasi by his followers and subsequently a tomb was constructedIn course of time this tomb became an object of pilgrimage and venerationUrs began to be held at the shrine every year and it was attended by a large number of devotees who made offerings before the shrineIt is partly from the income of these offerings that the tomb is maintainedCertain properties were endowed by the Emperors of Delhi in favour of this tomb and accretions were made to the said properties by the savings from the income of the endowed properties and the offerings brought by the devotees7The tomb was managed by a body of persons known as Khuddams of the DargaThis body had been looking after the Darga and the performance of ceremonies and other services at the shrineWhilst the management of the Darga was being thus carried on, Oudh came to be annexed in 1856 and the proclamation issued by Lord Canning confiscated all private properties and inams in the said StateFresh settlements were, however, subsequently made by the Government as a result of which previously existing rights were revived usually on the same terms as beforeThis happened in regard to the properties appertaining to the Darga8It would appear that in 1859 or 1860 a Sanad had been granted to Fakirulla who was the head of the khadims in respect of rent-free tenure of the village Singha ParasiThe grantee was given the right to collect the usufruct of the village which was to be appropriated towards the maintenance of the DargaThe grantees son Inayatulla was apparently not satisfied with the limited rights granted under the Sanad and so he brought an action, Suit NoInayatullas suit was substantially dismissed on November 11, 1870, by the Settlement OfficerSoon after this decision, it was brought to the notice of the Chief Commissioner in 1872 that the khadims at the Darga were mismanaging the properties of the Darga and were not properly maintaining the Darga itselfOn receiving this complaint a committee of mussalmans was appointed to examine the affairs of the Darga and to make a reportThe committee submitted its report on February 20, 1877, and made recommendations for the improvement of the management of the Darga and its propertiesAccording to the committee, it was necessary to appoint a jury of five persons including two khadims to manage the Darga and its propertiesMeanwhile some of the lands appurtenant to the Darga had been sold and offerings made by the devotees as well as other properties had become the subject-matter of attachmentIn the interest of the Darga, Government then decided to take possession of the properties under the provisions of Pensions Act, (XXIII of 1873) This decision was reached after the Government had considered the report made by the Deputy Commissioner on August 31, 18789In this suit Inayatullah and two others who had joined him claimed possession of the Darga together with the buildings appurtenant thereto and village Singha ParasiTheir claim was decreed by the trial court; but on appeal the said decree was set aside on July 20, 1897Even so, the appellate court observed that it was not proper or competent for the Government to interfere in the management of the waqf and its properties; the Darga was a religious establishment within the meaning or Religious Endowments Act (XX of 1863) and the as sumption of the management of the Darga and its properties was unauthorised and improper10As a result of these observations the Legal Remembrancer to the Government of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh filed a suit, No9 of 1902, under s539 (present s92) of the Code of Civil ProcedureThis suit ended in a decree on December 3, 1902The scheme appears to have worked smoothly until 1934In 1934 Ashraf Ali and others clamed (Suit NoThe plaintiffs also prayed that the defendants should be prohibited from spending monies

management of a trust and issued an order directing the defendant committee that no money out of the Darga funds should be spent either in the litigation pending before him, or in any other litigation, without the sanction of the court11For nearly six years after the date of this order the Darga and its properties appear to have been free from any litigationThis peace was, however, again

the village of Singha Parasi and properties appurtenant to itP XIII of 1936) (hereinafter described as the Act)The declaration, the consequential injunction and the two other subsidiary reliefs are

defendants 2 and 3 and they are respondents 2 and 3 before us25 of 1946)That is the basis of the reliefs claimed by the appellants in their plaint2The appellants claim was resisted by respondent I on several grounds34In his opinion it was not the village Singha Parasi but its profits free from land revenue that had been granted in trust for the shrine and its khadims and since the usufruct of the profits was subject to the condition of resumption and since the profits had not been vested in the Almighty, the grant cannot be construed to be a waqf as contemplated by Muhamniadan Law53 of the Act was partly upheld by the learned trial judge he took the view that the first three relief,-, claimed by the appellants were barred but the fourth was notThe rest of the appellants claim was dismissedThis decree was passed on April 15, 19475Against this decree respondent I preferred an appeal in the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (Lucknow Bench) and the appellants filed cross objectionsAs a result of these findings the appeal preferred by respondent I was allowed, the appellants cross-objections were dismissed, the decree passed by the trial court was set aside and the appellants suit dismissed (April 22, 1953)133 of the Constitution6Though the dispute between the parties raises only three principal issues, the facts leading to the litigation are somewhat complicated  and it is necessary to mention them in order to get a clear picture of the background of the present disputeIt is believed that Syed Salar Mahsood Ghazi was a nephew of Muhammad Ghazni and he met his death at the hands of a local chieftain when he paid a visit to BahraichOn his death his remains were buried in village Singha Parasi by his followers and subsequently a tomb was constructedIn course of time this tomb became an object of pilgrimage and venerationUrs began to be held at the shrine every year and it was attended by a large number of devotees who made offerings before the shrineIt is partly from the income of these offerings that the tomb is maintainedCertain properties were endowed by the Emperors of Delhi in favour of this tomb and accretions were made to the said properties by the savings from the income of the endowed properties and the offerings brought by the devotees7The tomb was managed by a body of persons known as Khuddams of the DargaThis body had been looking after the Darga and the performance of ceremonies and other services at the shrineWhilst the management of the Darga was being thus carried on, Oudh came to be annexed in 1856 and the proclamation issued by Lord Canning confiscated all private properties and inams in the said StateFresh settlements were, however, subsequently made by the Government as a result of which previously existing rights were revived usually on the same terms as beforeThis happened in regard to the properties appertaining to the Darga8It would appear that in 1859 or 1860 a Sanad had been granted to Fakirulla who was the head of the khadims in respect of rent-free tenure of the village Singha ParasiThe grantee was given the right to collect the usufruct of the village which was to be appropriated towards the maintenance of the DargaThe grantees son Inayatulla was apparently not satisfied with the limited rights granted under the Sanad and so he brought an action, Suit NoInayatullas suit was substantially dismissed on November 11, 1870, by the Settlement OfficerSoon after this decision, it was brought to the notice of the Chief Commissioner in 1872 that the khadims at the Darga were mismanaging the properties of the Darga and were not properly maintaining the Darga itselfOn receiving this complaint a committee of mussalmans was appointed to examine the affairs of the Darga and to make a reportThe committee submitted its report on February 20, 1877, and made recommendations for the improvement of the management of the Darga and its propertiesAccording to the committee, it was necessary to appoint a jury of five persons including two khadims to manage the Darga and its propertiesMeanwhile some of the lands appurtenant to the Darga had been sold and offerings made by the devotees as well as other properties had become the subject-matter of attachmentIn the interest of the Darga, Government then decided to take possession of the properties under the provisions of Pensions Act, (XXIII of 1873) This decision was reached after the Government had considered the report made by the Deputy Commissioner on August 31, 18789In this suit Inayatullah and two others who had joined him claimed possession of the Darga together with the buildings appurtenant thereto and village Singha ParasiTheir claim was decreed by the trial court but on appeal the said decree was set aside on July 20, 1897Even so, the appellate court observed that it was not proper or competent for the Government to interfere in the management of the waqf and its properties the Darga was a religious establishment within the meaning or Religious Endowments Act (XX of 1863) and the as sumption of the management of the Darga and its properties was unauthorised and improper10As a result of these observations the Legal Remembrancer to the Government of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh filed a suit, No9 of 1902, under s539 (present s92) of the Code of Civil ProcedureThis suit ended in a decree on December 3, 1902The scheme appears to have worked smoothly until 1934In 1934 Ashraf Ali and others clamed (Suit NoThe plaintiffs also prayed that the defendants should be prohibited

of the Assessment year 1948-49, reversing that of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Income tax, Range C , Calcutta, dated September 5, 19532The facts of this case leading upto this appeal are as follows: 3The appellant is engaged in various types of business activities, being a share-holder and Director or Managing Director of several limited liability concerns, and is also a partner in the firm known as  Pioneer Engineering Works 59,000/- (1947- 48)1,95,000/-, though standing in his name, belong to other members of his family, including his father and his wife4The Hindusthan Co-operative Insurance Society Limited, of Calcutta, (hereinafter referred to as  the Society ), acquired a block of about 578 bighas of land lying between Diamond Harbour Road and Tollys Nullah, within the Municipal limits of the Corporation of Calcutta, between the years 1940 and 1942The Society decided to level the land thus acquired and to open out roads and after developing the same, it subdivided it into small plots and sites in different blocks suitable for residential purposes under its scheme called The New Alipore Land Development Scheme NoXVOne -such plot, being plot No77 in block  E  of the said Scheme, was agreed, by an agreement dated January 10, 1946, to be sold to the assessee at the rate of Rs2,550/- per katha13,099/- being 10% of the estimated price of the plot with an approximate area of 51 kathas, which subsequently, on exact measurement, was found to be 45-56 kathas19,649 (omitting annas), being 15% of the estimated price32,748/- being 25% of the estimated total price of the land, was paid by the assessee to the SocietyAll this area which the Society had undertaken to develop and sell to different purchasers in small plots, was in occupation of the Government, which had requisitioned it for purposes connected with the prosecution of the Second World WarIt was further stipulated that the assessee would be entitled to apply, within three months of the receipt of the notice of derequisition, for extension of time not exceeding one year, for the completion of the transaction on the condition that he paid interest at the rate of 7% per annum on the outstanding amount, during the extended period32,748/-, already paid, would amount to 50% of the total price of the plot in question (within six months of the notice of de-requisition), he could get a conveyance of the property on his executing an English Mortgage for the remaining 50% of the price carrying interest at the rate of 7%, on the expiry of these aforesaid six monthsAs there was an apprehension that the Government might acquire the whole property for its own purpose, it was further stipulated that in the event of such an acquisition by Government, the agreement for sale would stand rescinded, and the assessee, in that event, would be entitled to re-payment of the amounts paid by him to the Society by way of advance for the completion of the transactionThe assessees case is that as the terms of the payment of purchase-price in several instalments, as aforesaid, were convenient to him, he agreed to take the plot on the conditions aforesaid, with a view to building a residential house for himself and constructing a workshop in connection with his business activityAt the end of the Second World War, the assesees construction activities began to decline, and there was no immediate prospect of the land in question being de-requisitioned by GovernmentIn those circumstances, the assessee negotiated for the assignment of his rights under the agreement with the Society, to Rani Yuddha Rajya Devi of NepalThe Rani appeared to have taken a fancy to the plot and to have made an attractive offer to the appellantHence, after exchange of letters between the parties, it was agreed between them that a sum of RsAfter a good deal of correspondence, on December 27, 1950, the Society executed a deed of conveyance in respect of the said plot, to the daughter of the said Rani as the vendeeThe aforesaid vendee executed a deed of mortgage in favour of the Society for the outstanding amount of Rs32,700 odd to the SocietyIn the result, the assessee received, on April 3, 1947, a sum of Rs1,07,000 odd from the Rani, in pursuance of the agreement between her and the assesseeUntil the execution of the sale-deed between the Society and the Ranis nominee, as aforesaid, the assessee continued to be liable to the Society in respect of the agreement of January 10, 1946The property, including the plot in question, was not de-requisitioned until some time in 194952,000 odd for the financial year 1947-4823(2) of the Income-tax Act, the assessee appeared before the Income-tax Officer, Calcutta, and produced all his books of account, including his bank accounts6He pointed out that under the Scheme, the Society had offered terms of purchase on instalments and on execution of a mortgage in respect of the vended property to the extent of 50% of the consideration money2,45,000/- in shares of different limited concernsIn the result, he made him liable to pay Capital Gains tax7The Department went up in appeal to the Income tax Appellate Tribunal, which, by its judgment dated March 26, 1954, allowed the appealThe admitted shares worth Rs2,45,000/- standing in his name, the Tribunal pointed out, were held by the assessee, in respect of the major portion, on behalf of other members of his familyThis conclusion does not appear to have been well-founded in factThe accounts do show credits in favour of the assessee of a larger amount8Admittedly, he is a director of about a dozen concerns and managing director of two or threeHer is -/8/- annas partner in an Engineering concern which is carrying out a number of construction

borne out by the entries in the books of account of that company); 1098,000 odd, the outstanding amount of the purchasemoney, to the Insurance Company ; 11That the assessee had no means to construct a house on the land, and lastly, 12That the site itself fetched no income, thus, showing that it could not be an investment but only an excursion into the realm of trade1314The Commissioner of Income-tax (AIR 1959 SC 359 1958 Indlaw SC 104)Speaking for the Court, Gajendragadkar, J, after a detailed discussion of the decisions of this Court Meenakshi Mills, Madurai vCommissioner of Income-tax, Madras ([1956] SCR 691 1956 Indlaw SC 56) and The Oriental Investment Co,, Ltd vCommissioner of Income-tax, Bombay ([1958] SCR 49 1957 Indlaw SC 36), and of the House of Lords, in Edwards vBairstow (36 TC 207), came to the conclusion that the question arising in the case, is a mixed question of law and fact, and, therefore, open to examination by this Court2, sub-s(4)It is patent that the clause in the nature of trade postulates the existence of certain elements in the adventure which in law would invest it with the character of a trade or business;The recent decision of this Court has examined almost all the relevant cases decided in Indian as also English and Scotch Courts, and thus, our task in the present case, has been very much simplifiedIt has further been observed in that case, more than once, that judicial opinion was unanimous that no general principles or universal tests could be laid down, which could govern the decision of all cases in which the question for

Income tax, Range C , Calcutta, dated September 5, 19532The facts of this case leading upto this appeal are as follows: 3The appellant is engaged in various types of business activities, being a share-holder and Director or Managing Director of several limited liability concerns, and is also a partner in the firm known as  Pioneer Engineering Works 59,000/- (1947- 48)1,95,000/-, though standing in his name, belong to other members of his family, including his father and his wife4The Hindusthan Co-operative Insurance Society Limited, of Calcutta, (hereinafter referred to as  the Society ), acquired a block of about 578 bighas of land lying between Diamond Harbour Road and Tollys Nullah, within the Municipal limits of the Corporation of Calcutta, between the years 1940 and 1942The Society decided to level the land thus acquired and to open out roads and after developing the same, it subdivided it into small plots and sites in different blocks suitable for residential purposes under its scheme called The New Alipore Land Development Scheme NoXVOne -such plot, being plot No77 in block  E  of the said Scheme, was agreed, by an agreement dated January 10, 1946, to be sold to the assessee at the rate of Rs2,550/- per katha13,099/- being 10% of the estimated price of the plot with an approximate area of 51 kathas, which subsequently, on exact measurement, was found to be 45-56 kathas19,649 (omitting annas), being 15% of the estimated price32,748/- being 25% of the estimated total price of the land, was paid by the assessee to the SocietyAll this area which the Society had undertaken to develop and sell to different purchasers in small plots, was in occupation of the Government, which had requisitioned it for purposes connected with the prosecution of the Second World WarIt was further stipulated that the assessee would be entitled to apply, within three months of the receipt of the notice of derequisition, for extension of time not exceeding one year, for the completion of the transaction on the condition that he paid interest at the rate of 7% per annum on the outstanding amount, during the extended period32,748/-, already paid, would amount to 50% of the total price of the plot in question (within six months of the notice of de-requisition), he could get a conveyance of the property on his executing an English Mortgage for the remaining 50% of the price carrying interest at the rate of 7%, on the expiry of these aforesaid six monthsAs there was an apprehension that the Government might acquire the whole property for its own purpose, it was further stipulated that in the event of such an acquisition by Government, the agreement for sale would stand rescinded, and the assessee, in that event, would be entitled to re-payment of the amounts paid by him to the Society by way of advance for the completion of the transactionThe assessees case is that as the terms of the payment of purchase-price in several instalments, as aforesaid, were convenient to him, he agreed to take the plot on the conditions aforesaid, with a view to building a residential house for himself and constructing a workshop in connection with his business activityAt the end of the Second World War, the assesees construction activities began to decline, and there was no immediate prospect of the land in question being de-requisitioned by GovernmentIn those circumstances, the assessee negotiated for the assignment of his rights under the agreement with the Society, to Rani Yuddha Rajya Devi of NepalThe Rani appeared to have taken a fancy to the plot and to have made an attractive offer to the appellantHence, after exchange of letters between the parties, it was agreed between them that a sum of RsAfter a good deal of correspondence, on December 27, 1950, the Society executed a deed of conveyance in respect of the said plot, to the daughter of the said Rani as the vendeeThe aforesaid vendee executed a deed of mortgage in favour of the Society for the outstanding amount of Rs32,700 odd to the SocietyIn the result, the assessee received, on April 3, 1947, a sum of Rs1,07,000 odd from the Rani, in pursuance of the agreement between her and the assesseeUntil the execution of the sale-deed between the Society and the Ranis nominee, as aforesaid, the assessee continued to be liable to the Society in respect of the agreement of January 10, 1946The property, including the plot in question, was not de-requisitioned until some time in 194952,000 odd for the financial year 1947-4823(2) of the Income-tax Act, the assessee appeared before the Income-tax Officer, Calcutta, and produced all his books of account, including his bank accounts6He pointed out that under the Scheme, the Society had offered terms of purchase on instalments and on execution of a mortgage in respect of the vended property to the extent of 50% of the consideration money2,45,000/- in shares of different limited concernsIn the result, he made him liable to pay Capital Gains tax7The Department went up in appeal to the Income tax Appellate Tribunal, which, by its judgment dated March 26, 1954, allowed the appealThe admitted shares worth Rs2,45,000/- standing in his name, the Tribunal pointed out, were held by the assessee, in respect of the major portion, on behalf of other members of his familyThis conclusion does not appear to have been well-founded in factThe accounts do show credits in favour of the assessee of a larger amount8Admittedly, he is a director of about a dozen concerns and managing director of two or threeHer is

an investment but only an excursion into the realm of trade1314The Commissioner of Income-tax (AIR 1959 SC 359 1958 Indlaw SC 104)Speaking for the Court, Gajendragadkar, J, after a detailed discussion of the decisions of this Court Meenakshi Mills, Madurai vCommissioner of Income-tax, Madras ([1956] SCR 691 1956 Indlaw SC 56) and The Oriental Investment Co,, Ltd vCommissioner of Income-tax, Bombay ([1958] SCR 49 1957 Indlaw SC 36), and of the House of Lords, in Edwards vBairstow (36 TC 207), came to the conclusion that the question arising in the case, is a mixed question of law and fact, and, therefore, open to examination by this Court2, sub-s(4)It is patent that the clause in the nature of trade postulates the existence of certain elements in the adventure which in law would invest it with the character of a trade or businessThe recent decision of this Court has examined almost all the relevant cases decided in Indian as also English and Scotch Courts, and thus, our task in the present case, has been very much simplifiedIt has further been observed in that case, more than once, that judicial opinion was unanimous that no general principles or universal tests could be laid down, which could govern the decision of all cases in which the question for determination is similar to the one now before usEach case must be determined on the total impression created on the mind

departure It is a sovereign act which is neither grounded in law nor does it pretend to be soExamples of such catastrophic changes are to be found in declarations of war, treaties, dealings with foreign countries and aliens outside the StatePedlar, (1921) 2 AC 262But there is immunity from courts interference in respect of acts done by the State against an alien outside the StateThe question thus is always: Did the State or its agents purport to act catastrophically or subject to the ordinary course of the law?If it were the latter, the defence set up, of course, has no foundation11Such Courts have neither the means of deciding what is right nor the power of enforcing any decision which they make12It may have been just or unjust, politic or impolitic, beneficial or injurious, taken as a whole, to those whose interests are affectedThese are considerations into which their Lordships cannot enterIt is sufficient to say that, even if a wrong-has been done, it is a wrong for which no Municipal Court of justice can afford a remedy13AppSupplVol119 1872 Indlaw PC 4The principle of these cases has been extended to all new territories whether acquired by conquest, or annexation or cession or otherwise and also to rights, contracts, concessions, immunities and privileges erected by the previous paramount powerThese are held to be not binding on the succeeding power even though before annexation it was agreed between the two powers, that they would be respectedIt matters not how the acquisition has been brought aboutIt may be by conquest, it may be by cession following on treaty, it may be by occupation of territory hitherto unoccupied by a recognized rulerIn all cases the result is the sameAny inhabitant of the territory can make good in municipal courts established by the new sovereign any such rights, as that sovereign has, through his officers, recognizedSuch rights as he had under the rule of predecessors avail him nothingMay more, even if in a treaty of cession it is stipulated that certain inhabitants should enjoy certain rights, that does not give a title to those inhabitants to enforce these stipulations in the municipal CourtsThe right to enforce remains only with the high contracting parties14It would be no defence to that action that the act complained, of is an act of State, because as between the sovereign and his subjects there is no such thing as an act of State, and it is incumbent on his officers to show that their action which is under challenge is within the authority conferred on them by lawAltogether different considerations arise when the act of the sovereign has reference not to the rights of his subjects but to acquisition of territories belonging to another sovereignThat is a matter between independent sovereigns, and any dispute arising there from must be settled by recourse not to municipal law of either State but to diplomatic action, and that failing, to force15That is an act of State pure and simple, and that is its character until the process of acquisition is completed by conquest or cessionNow, the status of the residents of the territories which are thus acquired is that until acquisition is completed as aforesaid they are the subjects of the ex-sovereign of those territories and thereafter they become the subjects of the new sovereignIn law, therefore, the process of acquisition of new territories is one continuous act of State terminating on the assumption of sovereign powers de jure over them by the new sovereign and it is only thereafter that rights accrue to the residents of those territories as subjects of that sovereignIn other words, as regards the residents of territories which come under the dominion of a, new sovereign, the right of citizenship commences when the act of State terminates and the two, therefore, cannot co-existIt follows from this that no act done or declaration made by the new sovereign prior to his assumption of sovereign powers over acquired territories can quoad the residents of those territories be regarded as having the character of a law conferring on them rights such as could be agitated in his courts16It is, however, otherwise if the act of the new sovereign is meant to be within the law and is not a concomitant of an act of StateOne such case was Forester and Others vIt was observed :- The act of Government in this case was not the seizure by arbitrary power of territories which up to that time had belonged to another sovereign State; it was the resumption of lands previously held from the government under a particular tenure, upon the alleged determination of that tenureThe possession was taken under colour of legal title, that title being the undoubted right of the sovereign power to resume, and retain or assess to the public revenue, all lands within its territories upon the determination of the tenure, under which they may have been exceptionally held rent free17A defence of this kind does not seek to justify the action with reference to the law but questions the very jurisdiction of the Courts to pronounce upon the legality or justice of the actionWe have now to consider whether the necessary facts to support the plea in defence existed in this caseAfter the lapse of paramountcy by reason of sHe left the country18On November 16, 1947, the following Notification was issued by the Administrator:- NOTIFICATION No9 of 1947568 of 1944 is cancelled19The people of Junagadh did not, strictly speaking, become the citizens of the Dominion till much later2021All this is beside the point and does not truly interpret the act of State which had taken placeof sovereign power and that is done arbitrarily, on principles either outside or paramount to the municipal lawThe fact that the sovereign allows the inhabitants to retain their old laws and customs does not make the sovereign subject to them and all rights under those laws are held at the pleasure of the sovereignIt is only when the sovereign can be said to have purported to act within the laws that-the act of State ceases to afford a plea in defenceBefore that stage is reached, government may be influenced by the existing laws and rights and obligations but is not governed or bound by themHall, I COMP204; 98 ER 1045, Ruding vSmith, 2 HagCon384; 161 ER 774, two cases of conquest and E 1Co vcit)2223The appeal

catastrophic changes are to be found in declarations of war, treaties, dealings with foreign countries and aliens outside the StatePedlar, (1921) 2 AC 262But there is immunity from courts interference in respect of acts done by the State against an alien outside the StateThe question thus is always: Did the State or its agents purport to act catastrophically or subject to the ordinary course of the law?If it were the latter, the defence set up, of course, has no foundation11Such Courts have neither the means of deciding what is right nor the power of enforcing any decision which they make12It may have been just or unjust, politic or impolitic, beneficial or injurious, taken as a whole, to those whose interests are affectedThese are considerations into which their Lordships cannot enterIt is sufficient to say that, even if a wrong-has been done, it is a wrong for which no Municipal Court of justice can afford a remedy13AppSupplVol119 1872 Indlaw PC 4The principle of these cases has been extended to all new territories whether acquired by conquest, or annexation or cession or otherwise and also to rights, contracts, concessions, immunities and privileges erected by the previous paramount powerThese are held to be not binding on the succeeding power even though before annexation it was agreed between the two powers, that they would be respectedIt matters not how the acquisition has been brought aboutIt may be by conquest, it may be by cession following on treaty, it may be by occupation of territory hitherto unoccupied by a recognized rulerIn all cases the result is the sameAny inhabitant of the territory can make good in municipal courts established by the new sovereign any such rights, as that sovereign has, through his officers, recognizedSuch rights as he had under the rule of predecessors avail him nothingMay more, even if in a treaty of cession it is stipulated that certain inhabitants should enjoy certain rights, that does not give a title to those inhabitants to enforce these stipulations in the municipal CourtsThe right to enforce remains only with the high contracting parties14It would be no defence to that action that the act complained, of is an act of State, because as between the sovereign and his subjects there is no such thing as an act of State, and it is incumbent on his officers to show that their action which is under challenge is within the authority conferred on them by lawAltogether different considerations arise when the act of the sovereign has reference not to the rights of his subjects but to acquisition of territories belonging to another sovereignThat is a matter between independent sovereigns, and any dispute arising there from must be settled by recourse not to municipal law of either State but to diplomatic action, and that failing, to force15That is an act of State pure and simple, and that is its character until the process of acquisition is completed by conquest or cessionNow, the status of the residents of the territories which are thus acquired is that until acquisition is completed as aforesaid they are the subjects of the ex-sovereign of those territories and thereafter they become the subjects of the new sovereignIn law, therefore, the process of acquisition of new territories is one continuous act of State terminating on the assumption of sovereign powers de jure over them by the new sovereign and it is only thereafter that rights accrue to the residents of those territories as subjects of that sovereignIn other words, as regards the residents of territories which come under the dominion of a, new sovereign, the right of citizenship commences when the act of State terminates and the two, therefore, cannot co-existIt follows from this that no act done or declaration made by the new sovereign prior to his assumption of sovereign powers over acquired territories can quoad the residents of those territories be regarded as having the character of a law conferring on them rights such as could be agitated in his courts16It is, however, otherwise if the act of the new sovereign is meant to be within the law and is not a concomitant of an act of StateOne such case was Forester and Others vIt was observed :- The act of Government in this case was not the seizure by arbitrary power of territories which up to that time had belonged to another sovereign State it was the resumption of lands previously held from the government under a particular tenure, upon the alleged determination of that tenureThe possession was taken under colour of legal title, that title being the undoubted right of the sovereign power to resume, and retain or assess to the public revenue, all lands within its territories upon the determination of the tenure, under which they may have been exceptionally held rent free17A defence of this kind does not seek to justify the action with reference to the law but questions the very jurisdiction of the Courts to pronounce upon the legality or justice of the actionWe have now to consider whether the necessary facts to support the plea in defence existed in this caseAfter the lapse of paramountcy by reason of sHe left the country18On November 16, 1947, the following Notification was issued by the Administrator:- NOTIFICATION No9 of 1947568 of 1944 is cancelled19The people of Junagadh did not, strictly speaking, become the citizens of the Dominion till much later2021All this is beside the point and does not truly interpret the act of State which had taken placeof sovereign power and that is done arbitrarily, on principles either outside or paramount to the municipal lawThe fact that the sovereign allows the inhabitants to retain their old laws and customs does not make the sovereign subject to them and all rights under those laws are held at the pleasure of the sovereignIt is only when the sovereign can be said to have purported to act within the laws that-the act of State ceases to afford a plea in defenceBefore that stage is reached, government may be influenced by the existing laws and rights and obligations but is not governed or bound by themHall, I COMP204 98 ER 1045, Ruding vSmith, 2 HagCon384 161 ER 774,

amount on December 9, 1957, by the learned Chief Presidency Magistrate at BombayOn January 4, 1958, an application was made by the complainant before the learned Magistrate for cancellation of the bail; the learned Magistrate, however, dismissed the application on the ground that under sAgainst this order, the complainant preferred a revisional application before the High Court of BombayChagla C J and Datar J who heard these applications took the view that, under sThe learned Judges then considered the material produced before the Court and came to the conclusion that, in the present case, it would not be safe to permit the appellant to be at largeSpecial leave granted to the appellant has, however, been limited to the question of the construction of sThis question is no doubt of considerable importance and its decision would depend upon the construction of the relevant sections of the Code2The material provisions on the subject of bail are contained in ssIt provides that  when a person charged with the commission of a bailable offence is arrested or detained without warrant by an officer in charge of a police station or is brought before a court and is prepared at any time, while in the custody of such officer or at any stage of the proceedings before such court, to give bail, such person shall be released on bailThe section further leaves it to the discretion of the police officer or the court if he or it thinks fit to discharge the accused person on his executing a bond without sureties for his appearance and not to take bail from him497(1)Sub-section (2) deals with cases where it appears to the officer or the court that there are not reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has committed a non-bailable offence but there are sufficient grounds for further enquiry into his guilt and it lays down that in such cases the accused shall, pending such enquiry, be released, on bail or at the discretion of the officer or court, on the execution by him of a bond without sureties for his appearance as hereinafter providedSub-section (3) requires that, when jurisdiction under sub-s(2) is exercised in favour of an accused person, reasons for exercising such jurisdiction shall be recorded in writingSub-section (3A) which has been added in 1955 deals with cases where the trial of a person accused of any non- bailable offence is not concluded within a period of sixty days from the first day fixed for taking evidence in the case and it provides that such person shall, if he is in custody during the whole of the aid period, be released on bail unless for reasons to be recorded in writing the magistrate otherwise directs(1) to be arrested and committed to custodyThere is one more section to which reference must be made in this connection and that is s426 of the Code426(2A) which has been added in 1955(2) or (2B) is ultimately sentenced to imprisonment, the time during which he is so released shall be excluded in computing the term for which he is so sentencedThat briefly is -the scheme of the Code on the subject of bail3As soon as it appears that the accused person is prepared to give bail, the police officer or the court, before whom he offers to give bail, is bound to release him on such terms as to bail as may appear to the officer or the court to be reasonable497 have made definite improvement in favour of persons accused of non- bailable offences, it would nevertheless be correct to say that the grant of bail in such cases is generally a matter in the discretion of the authorities in questionThe classification of offences into the two categories of bailable and non-bailable offences may perhaps be explained on the basis that bailable offences are generally regarded as less grave and serious than non-bailable offencesOn this basis it may not be easy to explain why, for instance offences under ss477, 477A, 475 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code should be regarded as bailable whereas offences under s379 should be non-bailableHowever, it cannot be disputed that s496 recognizes that a person accused of a bailable offence has a right to be enlarged on bail and that is a consideration on which Shri Purushottam, for the appellant, has very strongly relied4496The omission to make such a provision is, according to Shri Parushottam, not the result of inadvertence but, is deliberate; and if that is so, it would not be legitimate or reasonable to clothe the High Courts with the power to cancel bails in such cases under s561 A It is this aspect of the matter which needs careful examination in the present case5It provides that nothing in the Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent power of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justiceIt is obvious that this inherent power can be exercised only for either of the three purposes specifically mentioned in the section561A can come into operation, subject further to the requirement that the exercise of such power must serve either of the three purposes mentioned in the said sectionIn prescribing rules of procedure legislature undoubtedly attempts to provide for all cases that are likely to arise; but it is not possible that any legislative enactment dealing with procedure, however carefully it may be drafted, would succeed in providing for all cases that may possibly arise in futureLacunae are sometimes discovered in procedural law and it is to cover such lacunae and to deal with cases where such lacunae are discovered that procedural law invariably recognizes the existence of inherent power in courts561A; and even in regard to the High Courts inherent power definite salutary safeguards have been laid down as to its exerciseThere can thus be no dispute about the scope and nature of the inherent power of the High Courts and the extent of its exercise6Now it is obvious that the primary object of criminal procedure is to ensure a fair trial of accused personsEvery criminal trial begins with the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused ; and provisions of the Code are so framed that a criminal trial should begin with and be throughout governed by this essential presumption ; but a fair trial has naturally two objects in view; it must be fair to the accused and must also be fair to the prosecutionThe test of fairness in a criminal trial must be judged from this dual point of viewIt is therefore of the utmost importance that, in a criminal trial, witnesses should be able to give evidence without any inducement or threat either from the prosecution or the defenceA criminal trial must never be so conducted by the prosecution as would lead to the conviction of an innocent person; similarly the progress of a criminal trial must not be obstructed by the accused so as to lead to the acquittal of a really guilty offenderThere can be no more important requirement of the ends of justice than the uninterrupted progress of a fair trial; and it is for the continuance of such a fair trial that the inherent powers of the High Courts are sought to be invoked by the prosecution in cases where it is alleged that accused persons, either by suborning or intimidating witnesses, are obstructing the smooth progress of a fair trial497 (5) specifically deals with such cases7496 is an absolute and an indefeasible right; and despite the order of the High Court, that right would still be available to the appellant496Thus presented, the argument no doubt is prima facie attractive; but a close examination of the provisions of s561AHis commitment to custody thereafter is not by reason of the fact that he is alleged to have committed a bailable offence at all; his commitment to custody is the result of a judicial order passed on the ground that he has forfeited his bail and that his subsequent conduct showed that, pending the trial, he cannot be allowed to be at largeNow, where a person is committed to custody under such an order, it would not be open to him to fall back upon his rights under s496 would in such circumstances be inapplicable to his case498496Shri Purushottam no doubt attempted to, argue that the operative part of the provisions of s498(1)9561 A of the Code [Mirza Mohammad Ibrahim vEmperor, AIR 1932All534 1932 Indlaw ALL 176, Seoti vRex, AI R 1948 All366 1948 Indlaw ALL 25, Bachchu Lal vState, AIR 1951 All836 1951 Indlaw ALL 32, Muunshi Singh vState, AIR 1952 All39 1951

of inherent power in that behalf was not inconsistent with the provisions of s498 as it then stoodAs we have already observed, if a fair trial is the main objective of the criminal procedure, any threat to the continuance of a fair trial must be immediately arrested and the smooth progress of a fair trial must be ensured; and this can be done, if necessary, by the exercise of inherent powerOmission of legislature to make a specific provision in that behalf is clearly due to oversight or inadvertence and cannot be regarded as deliberateIf the appellants contention is sound, it would

Medical Officer in charge of the District Jail, Fatehpur who found five injuries on his person, none of which were serious5The learned Judges, however, thought that the defence put their own case about the injuries in cross examination, suggesting that these might have been caused as a result of some beating that had been administered to him by the police at the time of his arrest6That being so, it was unsafe to rely upon the evidence of the eye-witnesses who wore interested witnessesAs to the manner in which the occurrence took place, the prosecution having concealed an important incident in the occurrence, the Court had not been told the entire truthThose who came to his rescue were entitled to commit assault in the exercise of the right of self-defence of the person of Brij Bhukhan and they could not be said to have committed any offence unless it is proved that any one of them had exceeded the right of private defenceHe, however, did not abandon the defence cast, as set forth by Brj Bhukhan, of the occurrence having taken place near his houseIndeed, he strongly contended that, having regard to the circumstances, the defence case in this respect was more probable7and a First Information Report was lodged at the police station three miles away a, 7 pby BuddhuIt is significant that noadequate reason for supposing that he had in fact done som, on a cart to lodge a report and it was about 3 ain the morning that he stated the fact of the SubInspector and he was told to waitThe SubInspector did not record his (Brij Bhukhans ) informationHe must have known that in the occurrence, whatever it was, that Ram Prasad had been very seriously assaultedHe himself had been convicted previously in a murder caseHe ought to have realised that if he himself was the victim of an unprovoked assault, how necessary it was to have his version of the occurrence recorded as soon as possible after the occurrence8in the morning, although the Police Officer Karan Singh had searched for him at his house from 8 pwhen he could not find him thereUltimately at about 2, he found him outside his house and arrested himHe could have had himself medically examined at Ghaziapur three miles away but he did not do soBelieving or disbelieving witnesses is essentially a matter for the Courts of feet and in an appeal by special leave this Court will not ordinarily interfere with their discretionThis is not a case in which we should go behind the finding in this respect9Consequently the question of exercise of the right of private defence does not ariseIt may have been that he received them at the hands of the police at the time of his arrest when he was trying to escape, although Karen Singh was not prepared to admit any such thing10He urged that in view of the medical evidence the offence committed by the assailants of Ram Prasad was not murder because none of them have been proved to be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and the 3rd clause of S 300, Indian Penal Code, was not applicable5, which was a contused area 7 x 8 over the left buttock and upper of left thigh (upper forth back) with five contusions varying in length from 3 x 2 and breadth 3/4xl with abrasion rupee size near scrotum, must have largely contributed to the death of Ram PrasadMajor portion of the injuries are of a kind indicating that they had been inflicted upon a man who had fallen downBoth the chambers of the heart were found empty which clearly indicated haemorrhageIn our opinion, if the prosecution evidence in this respect is accepted, the offence was clearly one of murder11It was next contended that the evidence consists of interested persons only and corroboration by independent persons or by circumstantial evidence was necessaryIn our opinion, there was ample corroboration by way of circumstantial evidence as to the place of occurrenceBlood had also been found on the bedding and clothing of the deceasedIt is not surprising therefore that

to the circumstances, the defence case in this respect was more probable7and a First Information Report was lodged at the police station three miles away a, 7 pby BuddhuIt is significant that noadequate reason for supposing that he had in fact done som, on a cart to lodge a report and it was about 3 ain the morning that he stated the fact of the SubInspector and he was told to waitThe SubInspector did not record his (Brij Bhukhans ) informationHe must have known that in the occurrence, whatever it was, that Ram Prasad had been very seriously assaultedHe himself had been convicted previously in a murder caseHe ought to have realised that if he himself was the victim of an unprovoked assault, how necessary it was to have his version of the occurrence recorded as soon as possible after the occurrence8in the morning, although the Police Officer Karan Singh had searched for him at his house from 8 pwhen he could not find him thereUltimately at about 2, he found him outside his house and arrested himHe could have had himself medically examined at Ghaziapur three miles away but he did not do soBelieving or disbelieving witnesses is essentially a matter for the Courts of feet and in an appeal by special leave this Court will not ordinarily interfere with their discretionThis is not a case in which we should go behind the finding in this respect9Consequently the question of exercise of the right of private defence does not ariseIt may have been that he received them at the hands of the police at the time of his arrest when he was trying to escape, although Karen Singh was not prepared to admit any such thing10He urged that in view of the medical evidence the offence committed by the assailants of Ram Prasad was not murder because none of them have been proved to be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and the 3rd clause of S 300, Indian Penal Code, was not applicable5, which was a contused area 7 x 8 over the left buttock and upper of left thigh (upper forth back) with five contusions varying in length from 3 x 2 and breadth 3/4xl with abrasion rupee size near scrotum, must have largely contributed to the death of Ram PrasadMajor portion of the injuries are of a kind indicating that they had been inflicted upon a man who had fallen downBoth the chambers of the heart were found empty which clearly indicated haemorrhageIn our opinion, if the prosecution evidence in this respect is accepted, the offence was clearly one of murder11It was next contended that the evidence consists of interested persons only and corroboration by independent persons or by circumstantial evidence was necessaryIn our opinion, there was ample corroboration by way of circumstantial evidence as to the place of occurrenceBlood had also been found on the bedding and clothing of the deceasedIt is not surprising therefore that the stains on the earth had disintegrated and their origin could not be determined12\n"}

these letters were shown to the Superintendent of PoliceThe latter sent the report to the Station Officer, Karol Bagh police station, with a direction to register a case under sThe Station Officer investigated the case and submitted a charge-sheet against the appellantHe also took in charge some of the letters said to have been received by X They contained a reference to photographs of a daughter of X, and at least one of the letters said that a sample photograph was being enclosed with itThese photographs, it appeared subsequently in evidence, were taken in the nude and were of a character which, if made public, would undoubtedly compromise the reputation of the girl as well as of her fatherX said in evidence that he first tried to persuade the father and other relatives of the appellant to exercise their influence on the appellant so as to put a stop to the blackmailHe, however, failed to get any sympathetic response from them3In November 1954, he met the appellant and requested him to behave properly; the appellant, however, said that it was his profession to extort money by blackmail through girls and he further threatened that he would circulate the photographs to the relatives of the girl unless hush money was paidThe learned Magistrate found that the appellant took indecent photographs of the girl by showing false love to her, and threatened X, in letters written to him, with publication of the photographs with intent to extort money from the latterThis was on May 18, 19564It appears, however, that on June 14, 1956, Kapur, J, of the Punjab High Court

by thereatening X and his daughter with injury to their reputation by publication of the nude photographs, with intent to cause alarm to themIt is pointed out that there was no reference to blackmail or extortion in the chargeThe argument before us is that the charge mentioned that the intent was to cause alarm only to X and his daughter, but the finding was that there was an attempt to extort money from X on the threat of publishing the objectionable photographs506, Indian Penal Code, was bad; he might have been found guilty under s511, Indian Penal Code, if a charge were properly made

property or to the person or reputation of anyone in whom that person is interested; the second part refers to the intent with which the threatening is done and it is of two categories : one is intent to cause alarm to the person threatened and the second is to cause that person to do any act which he is not legally bound to do or to omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do,

correct to say that the threat of publication of the photographs must have also caused alarm to X; but the real intention of the appellant appears to have been not so much to cause alarm only as to make X pay hush money to himIt is not unoften that a particular act in some of its aspects comes within the definition of a particular offence in the Indian Penal Code, while in other aspects, or

State of BiharFor three of the aforesaid quarters, namely those ending on December 31, 1945, March 31, 1947 and June 30, 1947, the assessee failed to file the necessary returns as required by the provisions of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1944 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), which was the Act in force during the material period; therefore, the assessee was assessed for those three quarters under sub-sFor the remaining four quarters, the assessee did file returnsThe Sales Tax Officer passed separate orders assessing the tax for all the seven quarters simultaneously on October 9, 19473,92,000The assessee then moved in appeal the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Tirhut Division, but the Commissioner dismissed the appeals by his order dated February 23, 1948The Board of Revenue was then moved in revision but, by its order dated July 31, 1948, the Board refused to interfereThe Board expressed the view that the finding of the Sales Tax Officer and the Commissioner that the books of account maintained by the assessee were not dependable was a finding of fact which could not be interfered with in revision;-therefore the assessing officer was bound to assess to the best of his judgment2By its order dated December 10, 1948, the Board rejected the applications for making a reference to the High Court on the same ground, namely, that no question of law was involved and the assessment orders were concluded by a concurrent finding of factThe assessee then moved the High Court and by its order dated April 27, 1949, passed in Miscellaneous Judicial Cases Nos13 to 19 of of 1949, the High Court directed the Board of Revenue to state a case on the following question: Whether the Sales Tax3The Board of Revenue then stated a case, and the High Court disposed of the reference by answering the question in the affirmative by its judgment and order dated January 8, 1952The assessee then moved this Court and obtained special leave to appeal from the said judgment and order of the High Court4Before we proceed to consider this contention of the assessee, it is necessary to clear the ground by delimiting the precise scope of the question referred to the High CourtIt is well settled that the jurisdiction of the High Court in the matter of incometax references is an advisory jurisdiction and under the Income-tax Act the decision of the Tribunal on facts is final, unless it can be successfully assailed on the ground that there was no evidence for the conclusion on facts recorded by the Tribunal or the conclusion was such as no reasonable body of persons could have arrived atIt is also well settled that the duty of the High Court is to start with the statement of the case as the final statement of the facts and to answer the question of law with reference to that statementThe provisions of the Indian Income-tax Act are in pari materia with the provisions of the Act under our consideration, the main scheme of the relevant provisions of the two Acts being similar in nature, though the wording of the provisions is not exactly the same(2) is not justified(5) of s10(2)(b)10(4) of the Act5At one place in its judgment, the High Court referred to a

the Act10(2)(b) of the Act, and the answer given to the question will govern those four quarters onlyHaving thus indicated the precise scope of the question referred to the High Court, we proceed now to consider the main contention of the assesseeWe must first read the relevant provisions of the statute under which the assessments were made6(2) states what the Commissioner shall do, if he is not satisfied without requiring the presence of a registered dealer who furnished the returns or production of evidence that the returns furnished in respect of any period are correct and complete; the clause states that in that event the Commissioner shall serve on the dealer a notice in the prescribed manner requiring him either to attend in person or to produce or cause to be produced any evidence on which such dealer may rely in support of his returnsThen comes cl(2) which must be quoted in extenso: (b) On the day specified in the notice or as soon afterwards as may be, the Commissioner, after hearing such evidence as the dealer may produce, and such other evidence as the Commissioner may require on specified points, shall assess the amount of tax due from the dealer723 of the Indian Income-tax Act, though there are some verbal differences between the two provisions8That expression is perhaps a little ambiguous, but read in the context of the statement of the case, the question can only mean this: can the assessing authority adopt a figure of gross turnover by pure guess and without referring to any materials on which the figure is based ?It is clear to us that, understood in that sense, the High Court has answered the question incorrectlyThe High Court went into an elaborate consideration, by way of comparison and contrast, of sub-sIt is unnecessary for us

interpreting the true nature and scope of elThe decision is that of Dhakeswari Cotton Mills Ltd vCommissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal [1955] 1 SCR 941 1954 Indlaw SC 9, 949This Court observed: As regards the second contention, we are in entire agreement with the learned Solicitor-General when he says that the Income-tax Officer is not fettered by technical rules of evidence and pleadings, and that he is entitled to act on material which may not be accepted as evidence in a Court of law, but there the agreement ends; because it is equally clear that in making the assessment under sub-sThere must be something more than bare suspicion to support the assessment under s23(3) 9In our view, the aforesaid observations clearly show that the High Court was in error in answering the question in the affirmativeThen, the High Court proceeded to consider certain decisions relating to the interpretation of sub-ss2310 of the Act was vitiated by that wrong approach10Learned counsel for the respondent has strongly urged two points in support of the answer which the High Court gaveFirstly, he has contended that, on a proper reading of the assessment orders and the orders of the Commissioner, it would appear that the gross turnover for the quarters in question was based on certain materials; therefore, the argument of learned counsel is that it is not correct to say that the figure of gross turnover was arbitrarily adopted or was adopted without reference to any evidence or any material at allWe have examined the assessment orders in question, which form part of the statement of the caseIt is not necessary to repeat those reasons, because we must accept the finding of fact arrived at by the assessing authorities that the returns and the books of account were not dependableThe assessing authorities rightly pointed out that several transactions were not entered in the books of account; and a surprise inspection made on July 15, 1947, disclosed certain transactions with a Bombay firm known as MessrsKishundas Lekhraj, which were not mentioned in the books of account; and finally, the assessee Was importing silver in the name of five confederates in order to suppress the details of the transactions etc2,28,370-12-0 while the accounts revealed a gross turnover of Rs1,48,204All these we must accept as correctLet us take, for example, the assessment

December 31, 1945, March 31, 1947 and June 30, 1947, the assessee failed to file the necessary returns as required by the provisions of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1944 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), which was the Act in force during the material period therefore, the assessee was assessed for those three quarters under sub-sFor the remaining four quarters, the assessee did file returnsThe Sales Tax Officer passed separate orders assessing the tax for all the seven quarters simultaneously on October 9, 19473,92,000The assessee then moved in appeal the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Tirhut Division, but the Commissioner dismissed the appeals by his order dated February 23, 1948The Board of Revenue was then moved in revision but, by its order dated July 31, 1948, the Board refused to interfereThe Board expressed the view that the finding of the Sales Tax Officer and the Commissioner that the books of account maintained by the assessee were not dependable was a finding of fact which could not be interfered with in revision-therefore the assessing officer was bound to assess to the best of his judgment2By its order dated December 10, 1948, the Board rejected the applications for making a reference to the High Court on the same ground, namely, that no question of law was involved and the assessment orders were concluded by a concurrent finding of factThe assessee then moved the High Court and by its order dated April 27, 1949, passed in Miscellaneous Judicial Cases Nos13 to 19 of of 1949, the High Court directed the Board of Revenue to state a case on the following question: Whether the Sales Tax3The Board of Revenue then stated a case, and the High Court disposed of the reference by answering the question in the affirmative by its judgment and order dated January 8, 1952The assessee then moved this Court and obtained special leave to appeal from the said judgment and order of the High Court4Before we proceed to consider this contention of the assessee, it is necessary to clear the ground by delimiting the precise scope of the question referred to the High CourtIt is well settled that the jurisdiction of the High Court in the matter of incometax

judgment and order Dt5 April 1954, of the Madras High Court in Civil Revision Petition No2292 of 1952, arising out of the judgment and order Dt11 August 1952, of the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal, Madras, in T A No863 of 1951] The Judgment was delivered by : T L Venkatarama Aiyyar, J 12Before the sales tax authorities, the disputes ranged over a number of items, but we are concerned in this appeal with only two of them1,98,929-0-3 being the price of foodgrains supplied by the respondents to their workmen3IX of 1939), in so far as they are relevant for the purpose of the present appealXXV of 1947 introducing several new provisions in the Act, and it is necessary to refer to them so far as they are relevant for the purpose of the present appeal2(i), the following Explanation (1)(i) was added: Subject to such conditions and restrictions, if any, as may be prescribed in this behalf the amount for which goods are sold shall, in relation to a works contract, be deemed to be the amount payable to the dealer for carrying out such contract, less such portion as may be prescribed of such amount, representing the usual proportion of the cost of labour to the cost of materials used in carrying out such contract42(ii) defining works contract as meaning any agreement for carrying out for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration the construction, fitting out, improvement or repair of any building, road, bridge or other immovable property or the fitting out, improvement or repair of any movable property Pursuant to the Explanation (1)(i) in s2(i), a new rule, rand then follows a scale varying with the nature of the contracts54(3)1,98,929-0-3, the contention of the respondents was that they were not doing business in the sale of foodgrains, that they had supplied them to the workmen when they were engaged in construction works in out of the way places, adjusting the price therefor in the wages due to them and that the amounts so adjusted were not liable to be included in the turnover6Against this decision, the respondents preferred Civil Revision Petition No2292 of 1952 to the High Court of MadrasThat was heard by Satyanarayana Rao and Rajagopalan JJwho decided both the points in their favourXXV of 1947, were ultra vires the powers of the Provincial Legislature, and that the claim based on those provisions to include Rs29,51,528-7-4 in the taxable turnover of the respondents could not be maintainedAs regards the item of Rs1,98,929-0-3 they held that the sale of foodgrains to the workmen was not in the course of any business of buying or selling those goods, that there was no profit motive behind it, that the respondents were not dealers as defined in sIn the result, both the amounts were directed to be excluded from the taxable turnover of the respondents133(1) of the Constitution7Before us, the learned Advocate-General of Madras did not press the appeal in so far as it relates to the sum of RsAs provisions similar to those in the Madras Act now under challenge are to be found in the sales tax laws of other States, some of those States, Bihar, Punjab, Mysore, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, applied for and obtained leave to intervene in this appeal, and we have heard learned counsel on their behalfSome of the contractors who are interested in the decision of this question, Gurbax Singh, MessrsUttam Singh Duggal and United Engineering Company, were also granted leave to intervene, and learned counsel representing them have also addressed us on the points raised89On that, there has been sharp conflict of opinion among the several High CourtsIn Pandit Banarsi Das vState of Madhya Pradesh ([1955] 6 STC 93 1954 Indlaw MUM 29), a Bench of the Nagpur High Court held, differing from the view taken by the Madras High Court in the judgment now under appeal, that the provisions of the Act imposing a tax on the value of the materials used in a construction on the footing of a sale thereof were valid, but that they were bad in so far as they enacted an artificial rule for determination of that value by deducting out of the total receipts a fixed percentage on account of labour charges, inasmuch as the tax might, according to that computation, conceivably fall on a portion of the labour charges and that would be ultra vires Entry 48State Of Rajasthan (AIR 1957 Raj104)In Mohamed Khasim vState of Mysore (AIR 1955 MYS146 1957 Indlaw KER 35), the Kerala High Court has likewise affirmed the validity of both the provisions imposing tax on construction works and the rules providing for apportionment of value on a percentage basisIn Jubilee Engineering Co, Ltd v10We shall briefly refer to some of the authorities cited in support of this positionIn British Coal Corporation vKing ([1935] AC 500, 518), the question was whether s17 of the Canadian Statute, 22 & 24, GeoV, c53, which abolished the right of appeal to the Privy Council from any judgment or order of any court in any criminal case, was intra vires its powers under the, Constitution Act of 1867In answering it in the affirmative, Viscount Sankey L C observed: Indeed, in interpreting a constituent or organic statute such as the Act, that construction most beneficial to the widest possible amplitude of its powers must be adoptedThis principle has been again clearly laid down by the Judicial Committee in Edwards vA G for Canada ([1930] AC 124 11Commonwealth of Australia ([1936] AC 578  Lord Wright observed that a Constitution must not be construed in any narrow and pedantic senseIn In re the Central Provinces and Berar Act NoXIV of 1938 ([1939] FCR 181938 Indlaw FDH 1, discussing the principles of interpretation of a constitutional provision, Sir Maurice Gwyer C J observed: I conceive that a broad and liberal spirit should inspire those whose duty it is to interpret it; but I do not imply by this that they are free to stretch or pervert the language of the enactment in the interests of any legal or constitutional theory, or even for the purpose of supplying omissions or of correcting supposed errorsA Federal Court will not strengthen, but only derogate from, its position, if it seeks to do anything but declare the law; but it may rightly reflect that a Constitution of a Government is a living and organic thing, which of all instruments has the greatest claim to be construed ut res magis valeat quam pereat1213Deputy Federal Commissioner of Land Tax, N S W ([1912] 15 CLR 661, 666) and Broken Hill South Ltd vCommissioner of Taxation (NS W) ([1937] 56 CLR 337) in support of his contentionIn upholding the Act, Griffith C J observed : In my opinion, the Federal Parliament in selecting subjects of taxation is entitled to take things as it finds them in re rum nature, irrespective of any positive laws of the States prescribing rules to be observed with regard to the acquisition or devolution of formal title to property, or the institution of judicial proceedings with respect to it14Commissioner of Taxation, N S W ([1937] 56 CLR 337), the observations relied on are the following: In any investigation of the Constitutional powers of these great Dominion legislatures, it is not proper that a court should deny to such a legislature the right of solving taxation problems unfettered by a priori legal categories which often derive from the, exercise of legislative power in the same constitutional unit15According, to Blackstone,  sale or exchange is a transmutation of property from one man to another, in consideration of some price or recompense in valueIn Halsburys Laws of England, Second Edn, Vol29, paraI, we have the following: Sale is the transfer of the ownership of a thing from one person to another for a money priceThe law relating to contracts of exchange or barter is undeveloped, but the courts seem inclined to follow the maxim of civil law, permutatio vicina est emptioni, and to deal with such contracts as analogous to contracts of sale16In Corpus Juris, Vol55, the law is thus stated: Sale  in legal nomenclature, is a term of precise legal import, both at law and in equity, and has a well defined  legal signification, and has been said to mean, at all times, a contract between parties to give and pass rights of property for money, which the buyer pays or promises to pay to the seller for the thing bought or sold17or broad meaning, according to the context In Williston on Sales, 1948 Edn18The Commissioners of Inland Revenue ([1922] 12 TC 545)There, an agreement was entered into on April 12, 1918, for the sale of the trading stock in a brewery business and the transaction was actually completed on June 24, 1918In between the two dates, the Finance Act, 1918, had( imposed excess profits tax, and the question was whether the agreement dated April 12, 1918, amounted to a sale in which case the transaction would fall outside the operation of the ActSankey J agreed with this decision, but rested it on the ground that as the agreement left some matters still to be determined and was, in certain respects, modified later, it could not be held to be a sale for the purpose of the Act1920Vide Poppatlal Shah vThe United Motors (India) Ltd ([1953] SCR 1069 1953 Indlaw SC 97MessrsWhat its connotation in that sense is, must now be ascertainedFor a correct determination thereof, it is necessary to digress somewhat into the evolution of the law relating to sale of goods21The concept of sale, as it now obtains in our jurisprudence, has its roots in the Roman lawUnder that law, sale, emptio venditio, is an agreement by which one person agrees to transfer to another the exclusive possession (vacuagn possesionem tradere) of something (merx) for considerationIn the earlier stages of its development, the law was unsettled whether the consideration for sale should be money or anything valuableBy a rescript of the Emperors Diocletian and Maximian of the year 294 AD, it was finally decided that it should be money, and this law is embodied in the Institutes of Justinian, vide Title XXIIIEmptio venditio is, it may be noted, what is known in Roman law as a consensual contract, (1) Parties competent to contract; (2) mutual assent; (3) a thing, the absolute or general property in which is transferred from the seller to the buyer; and (4) a price in money paid or promised2271 codified the law on the subject, and s231 to 75 provisions applicable in general to all contracts, and then deals separately with particular kinds of contract such as sale, guarantee, bailment, agency and partnership, and the scheme necessarily posits that all these transactions are based on agreements24Unless all these elements are present, there can be no sale25Wong Kim Ark ([1898] 169 US 649 : 42 LEd890, 893), it was observed: In this, as in other respects, it must be interpreted in the light of the common law, the principles and history of which were familiarly known to the framers of the ConstitutionThe language of the Constitution, as has been well said, could not be understood without reference to the common law26In South Carolina vUnited States ([1905] 199 US 437 : 50 LEd262, 265), Brewer J observed: To determine the extent of the grants of power, we must, therefore, place ourselves in the position of the men who framed and adopted the Constitution, and inquire what they must have understood to be the meaning and scope of those grants27A more recent pronouncement is that of Taft C J who said: The language of the Constitution cannot be interpreted safely except by reference to the common law and to British institutions as they were when the instrument was framed and adoptedThe statesmen and lawyers of the Convention, who submitted it to the, ratification of the Conventions of the thirteen states, were born and brought up in the atmosphere of the common law, and thought and spoke in its vocabulary Ex-parte Grossman ([1925] 267 US 87 : 69 L Ed527, 530)In answer to the above line of authorities, the appellant relies on the following observations in Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago vChicago Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company ([1935] 294 US 648 : 79 LEd1110, 1124): Whether a clause in the Constitution is to be restricted by the rules of the English law as they existed when the Constitution was adopted depends upon the terms or the nature of the particular clause in questionCertainly, these rules have no such restrictive effect in respect of any constitutional grant of governmental power (Waring vClarke ((1847) 5 How441 : 12 LEd226), though they do, at least in some instances, operate restrictively in respect of clauses of the Constitution which guarantee and safeguard the fundamental rights and liberties of the individual, the best examples of which, perhaps, are the Sixth and Seventh Amendments, which guarantee the right of trial by jury28It should, however, be stated that the law is stated in Weaver on Constitutional Law, 1946  and Crawford on Statutory Construction,  in the same terms as in South Corolina vUnited States ([1905] 199 US 437 : 50 LEd262, 265)In LUnion St Jacques De Montreal vBe Lisle ([1874] LR 6 PC 31, 36), the question was whether a law of Quebec providing for relief to a society in a state of financial embarrassment was one with respect to  bankruptcy and insolvency 29In Royal Bank of Canada vLarue ([1928] AC 187), the question was whether s11, sub-s(10), of the Bankruptcy Act of Canada under which a charge created by a judgment on the real assets of a debtor was postponed to an assignment made by the debtor of his properties for the benefit of his creditors was intra vires the powers of the Dominion Legislature, as being one in respect of  bankruptcy and insolvency  within s91, sub-cl(21), of the British North America ActViscount Cave L C applying the test laid down in Union St Jacques De Montreal vBe Lisle ([1874] LR 6 PC 31, 36), held that the impugned provision was one in respect of bankruptcy30John East Iron Works Ltd ([1949] AC 134), the question arose under s96 of the British North America Act, 1867, under which the Governor-General of the Dominion had power to appoint judges of the superior district and county courtsThe Province of Saskatchewan enacted the Trade Union Act, 1944, authorising the Governor of the Province to constitute the Labour Relations Board for the determination of labour disputes3196 of the British North America ActIn holding that it was not, Lord Simonds observed that the courts contemplated by s96 could not be interpreted as comprehending a tribunal of the character of the Labour Relations BoardIn Halsburys Laws of England, Volgas to customs legislation32Dunphy ([1933] AC 156, 165), the question was as to the validity of certain provisions in a Canadian statute providing for the search of vessels beyond territorial watersThese provisions occurred in a customs statute, and were intended to prevent evasion of its provisions by smugglers33In Wallace Brothers and Co Ltd vCommissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City and Bombay Suburban District ((1948) LR 75 IA 86 1948 Indlaw PC 47, 99), Lord Uthwatt observed: Where Parliament has conferred a power to legislate on a particular topic it is permissible and important in determining the scope and meaning of the power to have regard to what is ordinarily treated as embraced within that topic in the legislative practice of the United KingdomThe point of the reference is emphatically not to seek a pattern to which a due exercise of the power must conformThe object is to ascertain the general conception involved in the words in the enabling Act34In In re The Central Provinces and Berar Act NoXIV of 1938 ([1939] FCR 181938 Indlaw FDH 1, 37), in considering whether a tax on the sale of goods was a duty of excise within the meaning of Entry 45, in List I of SchVII, Sir Maurice Gwyer C J observed: Lastly, I am entitled to look at the manner in which Indian legislation preceding the Constitution Act had been accustomed to provide for the collection of excise duties; for Parliament must surely be presumed to have had Indian legislative practice in mind and, unless the context otherwise clearly requires, not to have conferred a legislative power intended to be interpreted in a sense not understood by those to whom the Act was to apply35F N Balsara ([1951] SCR 682 1951 Indlaw SC 63), in determining the meaning of the word  intoxicating liquor  in Entry 31 of List 11 of Sch36It is contended by the appellants quite rightly-that in interpreting the words of a Constitution the legislative practice relative thereto is not conclusiveMessrsBudh Prakash Jai Prakash ([1955] 1 SCR 243 1954 Indlaw SC 24), it was relied on for ascertaining the meaning and true scope of the very words which are now under consideration373839We shall examine these contentions seriatimThat is an argument open to the appellant, because rules of interpretation are only aids for ascertaining the true legislative intent and must yield to the context, where the contrary clearly appearsNow, what are the indications contra ?40Entry 31 is  Intoxicating liquors and narcotic drugs, that is to say, the production, manufacture, possession, transport, purchase and sale of intoxicating liquors, opium and other narcotic drugsBut this argument proceeds on a misapprehension of the principles on which the Entries are draftedThe scheme of the drafting is that there is in the beginning of the Entry words of general import, and they are followed by words having reference to particular aspects thereofThe operation of the general words, however, is not cut down by reason of the fact that there are sub-heads dealing with specific aspectsR S Nayudu ([1946] FCR 67, 84) occur the following observations pertinent to the present question : The subsequent words and phrases are not intended to limit the ambit of the opening general term or phrase but rather to illustrate the scope and objects of the legislation envisaged as comprised in the opening term or phrase41Entry 49 in List II2 of 19404243In Sydney Hydraulic and General Engineering Co vIn 1932, the Legislature intervened and enacted in the Statute of 1930, a new provision, s3(4), in the following terms: For the purpose of this Act, a person shall be deemed to have sold goods if, in the performance of any contract (not being a contract for the sale of goods) under which he has received, or is entitled to receive, valuable consideration, he supplies goods the property in which (whether as goods or in some other form) passes, under the terms of the contract, to some other person44After this, the question arose in M R Hornibrook (PtyThe majority of the Court

taxable sale51 of the Constitution Act is vested Exclusively in the Commonwealth ParliamentItem (ii) in sIn fact, two of the learned Judges in M R Hornibrook (Pty45The position in the American law appears to be the same as in AustraliaBut this decision Was overruled by a later decision of the same Court in Herlihy Mid-Continent Co vHe relied in support of this position on various dicta in Ex Parte Drake In re Ware ([1877] 5 ChD866), Great Western Railway Co vCommissioners of Inland Revenue ([1894] 1 QB 507, 512, 515), The Commissioners of Inland Revenue vNewcastle Breweries Ltd ([1927] 12 TC 927), Kirkness vJohn Hudson & Co LdDirector of Lands, Native Land Trust Board of Fiji ([1957] AC 325)46In Ex Parte Drake In re Ware ((1877) 5 ChD 866), the question was whether an unsatisfied decree passed in an action on detinue extinguished the title of the decree-holder to the thing detainedIn answering it in the negative, Jessel M R observed: The judgments in Brinsmead vHarrison and especially that of Mr Justice Willes, shew that the theory of the judgment in an action of detinue is that it is a kind of involuntary sale of the Plaintiffs goods to the Defendant47In Great Western Railway Co vCommissioners of Inland Revenue ([1894] 1 QB 507), an Act of Parliament had provided for the dissolution of two companies under a scheme of amalgamation with a third company under which the shareholders were to be given in exchange for their shares in the dissolved companies, in the case of one company, stock in the third company in certain specified proportions, and in the other, discharge of debentures on shares already held by them in the third companyIn rejecting this contention, Esher M R observed: Turning to the Stamp Act, the words used are  a conveyance on saleThe latter seems to me to be the meaning of the phrase as there used49Newcastle Breweries Ltd ([1927] 12 TC 927), the point for decision was whether payments made by the Admiralty to the respondent company which was carrying on business as brewers, on account of stocks of rum taken over by it compulsorily under the Defence of Realm Regulations were liable to be assessed as trade receipts to excess profits dutyIn rejecting this contention, Viscount Cave L C observed: If the raw rum had been voluntarily sold to other traders, the price must clearly have come into the computation of the Appellants profits, and the circumstance that the sale was compulsory and was to the Crown makes no difference in principle50John Hudson & Co Ltd ([1955] AC 696), the facts were that railway wagons belonging to the respondent company were taken over by the Transport Commission compulsorily in exercise of the powers conferred by s29 of the Transport Act, 1947, and compensation was paid thereforthe question whether it is a correct use of the English language to describe as a sale a transaction from which the element of mutual assent is missing is no doubt an interesting oneI think, however, that this question loses its importance for the purpose of the decision of this appeal when it is realized that for the last 100 years transactions by which the property of A has been transferred to B, Oil payment of compensation to the owner but without the consent of the owner, have been referred to many times, in Acts of Parliament, in opinions delivered in this House, in judgments of the Court of Appeal and the High Court of Justice, and in textbooks as a sale -generally as a compulsory sale- The case of Newcastle Breweries LdInland Revenue Commissioners ([1927] 96 LJKB735), referred to later, affords a striking modern instance of the use of the word I sale as applied to compulsory taking of goods  In these circumstances, whether this use of the word sale was originally correct or incorrect, I find it impossible to say that the only construction which can fairly be given to the word  sold  in s17(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1945, is to limit it to a transaction in which the element of mutual assent is present51But the majority of the House came to a different conclusion, and held that the element of bargain was essential to constitute a sale, and to describe compulsory taking over of property as a sale was a misuse of that word5215 of the Native Land Trust Ordinance, c86 of 1945, FijiThe decision, however, proceeded on the particular terms of the statute, and does not affect the decision in Kirkness v53It should be noted that the main ground on which the decision of Lord Morton rests is that compulsory acquisition of property had been described in the legislative practice of Great Britain as compulsory salesThe legislative practice of this country, however, has been differentPoppatlal Shah vThe United Motors (India) Ltd ([1953] SCR 1069 1953 Indlaw SC 97, 1078)It is unnecessary to discuss the other English cases cited above at any length, as the present question did not directly arise for decision therein, and the decision in Kirkness vJohn Hudson & Co Ld must be held to conclude the matter54To hold that there should be an agreement to sell the goods as such is, it is contended, to add to the Entry, words which are not there55We are unable to agree with this contentionWhere the goods delivered under the contract are not the goods contracted for, the purchaser has got a right to reject them, or to accept them and claim damages for breach of warrantyEdison Telephone Company of London ([1880] LR 6 QBD 244), Toronto Corporation vBell Telephone Company of Canada ([1905] AC 52), The Regulation and Control of Radio Communication in Canada, In re ([1932] AC 304) andBrislan: Ex Parte Williams ([1935] 54 CLR 262) were quoted as precedents for adopting such a constructionEdison Telephone Company of London (Supra), the question was whether the Edison Telephone Company, London, had infringed the exclusive privilege of transmitting telegrams granted to the Postmaster General under an Act of 1869 by installation of telephonesThe Court negatived this contention on the ground that the language of the definition was wide enough to include telephones92(10)(a) of the British North America Act, 1867, under which the Dominion Parliament had the exclusive competence to pass laws in respect of  lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs, and other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces or extending beyond the limits of the provinceThe question was whether a law incorporating a telephone company and conferring on it powers to enter upon streets and highways vested in a municipal corporation was intra vires the powers of the Dominion Parliament under the above provision, and whether in consequence a provision in an Ontario Act requiring the consent of the municipal authorities for the carrying out of those operations was ultra vires92(10)(a) and that, therefore, it prevailed over the Provincial Act56In The, Regulation and Control of Radio Communication in Canada, In re ([1932] AC 304), the question was whether broadcasting was covered by the expression telegraph and other works and undertakings  in sThe Privy Council answered it in the affirmative on the grounds, firstly, that broadcasting was an  undertaking connecting the province with other provinces and extending beyond the limits of the province and, secondly, that it fell within the description of telegraph Bristan: Ex Parte Williams ((1935) 54 CLR 262), the question was whether a law of the Commonwealth Parliament with respect to radio broadcasting was one with respect to  Postal, telegraphic, telephonic and other like services  under s51(5) of the Australian Commonwealth Act, and it was answered in the affirmative57The principle of these decisions is that when, after the enactment of a legislation, new facts and situations arise which could not have been in its contemplation, the statutory provisions could properly be applied to them if the words thereof are in a broad sense capable of containing themCommonwealth of Australia ([1936] AC 578 that the meaning of the words changes, but the changing circumstances illustrate and illuminate the full import of that meaningClearly, this principle has no application to the present case58Commercial Tax Officer (AIR 1957 Cal283 1957 Indlaw CAL 28) was relied on in support of this contention59107 can

vThe Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City ([1955] 1 SCR 829 1954 Indlaw SC 7061The nature and incidents of works contracts have been the subject of consideration in numerous decisions of the English courts, and there is a detailed consideration of the points now under discussion, in so far as building contracts, are concerned, in Hudson on Building Contracts,  and as regards chattels, in Benjamin on SaleIt is therefore sufficient to refer to the more important of the cases cited before usArmitage ((1839) 4 M & W 687 : 150 ER 1597), one Bennett, a builder, had entered into an agreement with certain trustees to build a hotelThe agreement provided inter alia that the articles which were to be used for the structure had to be approved by the trusteesSubsequently, Bennett became bankrupt, and the dispute was between his assignees in bankruptcy, and the trustees as regards title to certain wooden sash-frames which had been approved on behalf of the trustees but had not yet been fitted in the buildingThe trustees claimed them on the ground that property therein, had passed to them when once they had approved the sameIn negativing this contention, Lord Abinger C B observed: Parke B observed: but in this case, there is no contract at all with respect to these particular chattels-it is merely parcel of a larger contractThe contract is, that the bankrupt shall build a house; that he shall make, amongst other things, window-frames for the house, and fix them in the house subject to the approbation of a surveyor and it was never intended by this contract, that the articles so to be fixed should become the property of the defendants, until they were fixed to the freehold62Bulmer ((1843) 11 M & W 243 : 152 ER 793), the plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant  to build an engine of 100 horse power for the sum of E 2,500, to be completed and fixed by the middle or end of December Different parts of the engine were constructed at the plaintiffs manufactory and sent in parts to the defendants colliery where they were fixed piecemeal and were made into an engineThe suit was for the recovery of a sum of E 3,000 as price for  a main engine and other goods sold and delivered In upholding this contention, Parke B observed : The engine was not contracted for to be delivered, or delivered, as an engine, in its complete state, and afterwards affixed to the freehold; there was no sale of it, as an entire chattel, and delivery in that character and therefore it could not be treated as an engine sold and delivered63Moore ([1886] 11 AC 350), the facts were similar to those in Tripp vArmitage ((1839) 4 M & W 687 : 150 ER 1597)A firm of engineers, A Campbell & Son, had entered into five agreements with the appellants, T B Seath and Co, who were ship-builders to supply engines, boilers and machinery required for vessels to be built by themBefore the completion of the contracts, A Campbell & Son became bankrupt, and the dispute was as regards the title to machinery and other articles which were in the possession of the insolvents at the time of their bankruptcy but which had been made for the purpose of being fitted into the ships of the appellantsArmitage ((1839) 4 M & W 687 : 150 ER 1597) that there had been no sale of the machinery and parts as such, and that therefore they vested in the assigneeFor the appellant, reliance is placed on the following observations of Lord Watson: The English decisions to which I have referred appear to me to establish the principle that, where it appears to be the intention, or in other words the agreement, of the parties to a contract for building a, ship, that a particular stage of its construction, the vessel, so far as then finished, shall be appropriated to the contract of sale, the property of the vessel as soon as it has reached that stage of completion will pass to the purchaser, and subsequent additions made to the chattel thus vested in the purchaser will, accessione, become his property64That appears to me to have been matter of direct decision by the Court of Exchequer Chamber in Wood vBell ((1856) 6 E & B 355 : 119 ER 669)Russell ((1822) 5 B & Al65Macbeth & Gray ([1904] AC 223), the facts were that a firm of ship-builders who had agreed to build a ship became bankrupt6667Norman Wright (Builders) Ld69707172737475104 of the

April 1954, of the Madras High Court in Civil Revision Petition No2292 of 1952, arising out of the judgment and order Dt11 August 1952, of the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal, Madras, in T A No863 of 1951] The Judgment was delivered by : T L Venkatarama Aiyyar, J 12Before the sales tax authorities, the disputes ranged over a number of items, but we are concerned in this appeal with only two of them1,98,929-0-3 being the price of foodgrains supplied by the respondents to their workmen3IX of 1939), in so far as they are relevant for the purpose of the present appealXXV of 1947 introducing several new provisions in the Act, and it is necessary to refer to them so far as they are relevant for the purpose of the present appeal2(i), the following Explanation (1)(i) was added: Subject to such conditions and restrictions, if any, as may be prescribed in this behalf the amount for which goods are sold shall, in relation to a works contract, be deemed to be the amount payable to the dealer for carrying out such contract, less such portion as may be prescribed of such amount, representing the usual proportion of the cost of labour to the cost of materials used in carrying out such contract42(ii) defining works contract as meaning any agreement for carrying out for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration the construction, fitting out, improvement or repair of any building, road, bridge or other immovable property or the fitting out, improvement or repair of any movable property Pursuant to the Explanation (1)(i) in s2(i), a new rule, rand then follows a scale varying with the nature of the contracts54(3)1,98,929-0-3, the contention of the respondents was that they were not doing business in the sale of foodgrains, that they had supplied them to the workmen when they were engaged in construction works in out of the way places, adjusting the price therefor in the wages due to them and that the amounts so adjusted were not liable to be included in the turnover6Against this decision, the respondents preferred Civil Revision Petition No2292 of 1952 to the High Court of MadrasThat was heard by Satyanarayana Rao and Rajagopalan JJwho decided both the points in their favourXXV of 1947, were ultra vires the powers of the Provincial Legislature, and that the claim based on those provisions to include Rs29,51,528-7-4 in the taxable turnover of the respondents could not be maintainedAs regards the item of Rs1,98,929-0-3 they held that the sale of foodgrains to the workmen was not in the course of any business of buying or selling those goods, that there was no profit motive behind it, that the respondents were not dealers as defined in sIn the result, both the amounts were directed to be excluded from the taxable turnover of the respondents133(1) of the Constitution7Before us, the learned Advocate-General of Madras did not press the appeal in so far as it relates to the sum of RsAs provisions similar to those in the Madras Act now under challenge are to be found in the sales tax laws of other States, some of those States, Bihar, Punjab, Mysore, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, applied for and obtained leave to intervene in this appeal, and we have heard learned counsel on their behalfSome of the contractors who are interested in the decision of this question, Gurbax Singh, MessrsUttam Singh Duggal and United Engineering Company, were also granted leave to intervene, and learned counsel representing them have also addressed us on the points raised89On that, there has been sharp conflict of opinion among the several High CourtsIn Pandit Banarsi Das vState of Madhya Pradesh ([1955] 6 STC 93 1954 Indlaw MUM 29), a Bench of the Nagpur High Court held, differing from the view taken by the Madras High Court in the judgment now under appeal, that the provisions of the Act imposing a tax on the value of the materials used in a construction on the footing of a sale thereof were valid, but that they were bad in so far as they enacted an artificial rule for determination of that value by deducting out of the total receipts a fixed percentage on account of labour charges, inasmuch as the tax might, according to that computation, conceivably fall on a portion of the labour charges and that would be ultra vires Entry 48State Of Rajasthan (AIR 1957 Raj104)In Mohamed Khasim vState of Mysore (AIR 1955 MYS146 1957 Indlaw KER 35), the Kerala High Court has likewise affirmed the validity of both the provisions imposing tax on construction works and the rules providing for apportionment of value on a percentage basisIn Jubilee Engineering Co, Ltd v10We shall briefly refer to some of the authorities cited in support of this positionIn British Coal Corporation vKing ([1935] AC 500, 518), the question was whether s17 of the Canadian Statute, 22 & 24, GeoV, c53, which abolished the right of appeal to the Privy Council from any judgment or order of any court in any criminal case, was intra vires its powers under the, Constitution Act of 1867In answering it in the affirmative, Viscount Sankey L C observed: Indeed, in interpreting a constituent or organic statute such as the Act, that construction most beneficial to the widest possible amplitude of its powers must be adoptedThis principle has been again clearly laid down by the Judicial Committee in Edwards vA G for Canada ([1930] AC 124 11Commonwealth of Australia ([1936] AC 578  Lord Wright observed that a Constitution must not be construed in any narrow and pedantic senseIn In re the Central Provinces and Berar Act NoXIV of 1938 ([1939] FCR 181938 Indlaw FDH 1, discussing the principles of interpretation of a constitutional provision, Sir Maurice Gwyer C J observed: I conceive that a broad and liberal spirit should inspire those whose duty it is to interpret it but I do not imply by this that they are free to stretch or pervert the language of the enactment in the interests of any legal or constitutional theory, or even for the purpose of supplying omissions or of correcting supposed errorsA Federal Court will not strengthen, but only derogate from, its position, if it seeks to do anything but declare the law but it may rightly reflect that a Constitution of a Government is a living and organic thing, which of all instruments has the greatest claim to be construed ut res magis valeat quam pereat1213Deputy Federal Commissioner of Land Tax, N S W ([1912] 15 CLR 661, 666) and Broken Hill South Ltd vCommissioner of Taxation (NS W) ([1937] 56 CLR 337) in support of his contentionIn upholding the Act, Griffith C J observed : In my opinion, the Federal Parliament in selecting subjects of taxation is entitled to take things as it finds them in re rum nature, irrespective of any positive laws of the States prescribing rules to be observed with regard to the acquisition or devolution of formal title to property, or the institution of judicial proceedings with respect to it14Commissioner of Taxation, N S W ([1937] 56 CLR 337), the observations relied on are the following: In any investigation of the Constitutional powers of these great Dominion legislatures, it is not proper that a court should deny to such a legislature the right of solving taxation problems unfettered by a priori legal categories which often derive from the, exercise of legislative power in the same constitutional unit15According, to Blackstone,  sale or exchange is a transmutation of property from one man to another, in consideration of some price or recompense in valueIn Halsburys Laws of England, Second Edn, Vol29, paraI, we have the following: Sale is the transfer of the ownership of a thing from one person to another for a money priceThe law relating to contracts of exchange or barter is undeveloped, but the courts seem inclined to follow the maxim of civil law, permutatio vicina est emptioni, and to deal with such contracts as analogous to contracts of sale16In Corpus Juris, Vol55, the law is thus stated: Sale  in legal nomenclature, is a term of precise legal import, both at law and in equity, and has a well defined  legal signification, and has been said to mean, at all times, a contract between parties to give and pass rights of property for money, which the buyer pays or promises to pay to the seller for the thing bought or sold17or broad meaning, according to the context In Williston on Sales, 1948 Edn18The Commissioners of Inland Revenue ([1922] 12 TC 545)There, an agreement was entered into on April 12, 1918, for the sale of the trading stock in a brewery business and the transaction was actually completed on June 24, 1918In between the two dates, the Finance Act, 1918, had( imposed excess profits tax, and the question was whether the agreement dated April 12, 1918, amounted to a sale in which case the transaction would fall outside the operation of the ActSankey J agreed with this decision, but rested it on the ground that as the agreement left some matters still to be determined and was, in certain respects, modified later, it could not be held to be a sale for the purpose of the Act1920Vide Poppatlal Shah vThe United Motors (India) Ltd ([1953] SCR 1069 1953 Indlaw SC 97MessrsWhat its connotation in that sense is, must now be ascertainedFor a correct determination thereof, it is necessary to digress somewhat into the evolution of the law relating to sale of goods21The concept of sale, as it now obtains in our jurisprudence, has its roots in the Roman lawUnder that law, sale, emptio venditio, is an agreement by which one person agrees to transfer to another the exclusive possession (vacuagn possesionem tradere) of something (merx) for considerationIn the earlier stages of its development, the law was unsettled whether the consideration for sale should be money or anything valuableBy a rescript of the Emperors Diocletian and Maximian of the year 294 AD, it was finally decided that it should be money, and this law is embodied in the Institutes of Justinian, vide Title XXIIIEmptio venditio is, it may be noted, what is known in Roman law as a consensual contract, (1) Parties competent to contract (2) mutual assent (3) a thing, the absolute or general property in which is transferred from the seller to the buyer and (4) a price in money paid or promised2271 codified the law on the subject, and s231 to 75 provisions applicable in general to all contracts, and then deals separately with particular kinds of contract such as sale, guarantee, bailment, agency and partnership, and the scheme necessarily posits that all these transactions are based on agreements24Unless all these elements are present, there can be no sale25Wong Kim Ark ([1898] 169 US 649 : 42 LEd890, 893), it was observed: In this, as in other respects, it must be interpreted in the light of the common law, the principles and history of which were familiarly known to the framers of the ConstitutionThe language of the Constitution, as has been well said, could not be understood without reference to the common law26In South Carolina vUnited States ([1905] 199 US 437 : 50 LEd262, 265), Brewer J observed: To determine the extent of the grants of power, we must, therefore, place ourselves in the position of the men who framed and adopted the Constitution, and inquire what they must have understood to be the meaning and scope of those grants27A more recent pronouncement is that of Taft C J who said: The language of the Constitution cannot be interpreted safely except by reference to the common law and to British institutions as they were when the instrument was framed and adoptedThe statesmen and lawyers of the Convention, who submitted it to the, ratification of the Conventions of the thirteen states, were born and brought up in the atmosphere of the common law, and thought and spoke in its vocabulary Ex-parte Grossman ([1925] 267 US 87 : 69 L Ed527, 530)In answer to the above line of authorities, the appellant relies on the following observations in Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago vChicago Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company ([1935] 294 US 648 : 79 LEd1110, 1124): Whether a clause in the Constitution is to be restricted by the rules of the English law as they existed when the Constitution was adopted depends upon the terms or the nature of the particular clause in questionCertainly, these rules have no such restrictive effect in respect of any constitutional grant of governmental power (Waring vClarke ((1847) 5 How441 : 12 LEd226), though they do, at least in some instances, operate restrictively in respect of clauses of the Constitution which guarantee and safeguard the fundamental rights and liberties of the individual, the best examples of which, perhaps, are the Sixth and Seventh Amendments, which guarantee the right of trial by jury28It should, however, be stated that the law is stated in Weaver on Constitutional Law, 1946  and Crawford on Statutory Construction,  in the same terms as in South Corolina vUnited States ([1905] 199 US 437 : 50 LEd262, 265)In LUnion St Jacques De Montreal vBe Lisle ([1874] LR 6 PC 31, 36), the question was whether a law of Quebec providing for relief to a society in a state of financial embarrassment was one with respect to  bankruptcy and insolvency 29In Royal Bank of Canada vLarue ([1928] AC 187), the question was whether s11, sub-s(10), of the Bankruptcy Act of Canada under which a charge created by a judgment on the real assets of a debtor was postponed to an assignment made by the debtor of his properties for the benefit of his creditors was intra vires the powers of the Dominion Legislature, as being one in respect of  bankruptcy and insolvency  within s91, sub-cl(21), of the British North America ActViscount Cave L C applying the test laid down in Union St Jacques De Montreal vBe Lisle ([1874] LR 6 PC 31, 36), held that the impugned provision was one in respect of bankruptcy30John East Iron Works Ltd ([1949] AC 134), the question arose under s96 of the British North America Act, 1867, under which the Governor-General of the Dominion had power to appoint judges of the superior district and county courtsThe Province of Saskatchewan enacted the Trade Union Act, 1944, authorising the Governor of the Province to constitute the Labour Relations Board for the determination of labour disputes3196 of the British North America ActIn holding that it was not, Lord Simonds observed that the courts contemplated by s96 could not be interpreted as comprehending a tribunal of the character of the Labour Relations BoardIn Halsburys Laws of England, Volgas to customs legislation32Dunphy ([1933] AC 156, 165), the question was as to the validity of certain provisions in a Canadian statute providing for the search of vessels beyond territorial watersThese provisions occurred in a customs statute, and were intended to prevent evasion of its provisions by smugglers33In Wallace Brothers and Co Ltd vCommissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City and Bombay Suburban District ((1948) LR 75 IA 86 1948 Indlaw PC 47, 99), Lord Uthwatt observed: Where Parliament has conferred a power to legislate on a particular topic it is permissible and important in determining the scope and meaning of the power to have regard to what is ordinarily treated as embraced within that topic in the legislative practice of the United KingdomThe point of the reference is emphatically not to seek a pattern to which a due exercise of the power must conformThe object is to ascertain the general conception involved in the words in the enabling Act34In In re The Central Provinces and Berar Act NoXIV of 1938 ([1939] FCR 181938 Indlaw FDH 1, 37), in considering whether a tax on the sale of goods was a duty of excise within the meaning of Entry 45, in List I of SchVII, Sir Maurice Gwyer C J observed: Lastly, I am entitled to look at the manner in which Indian legislation preceding the Constitution Act had been accustomed to provide for the collection of excise duties for Parliament must surely be presumed to have had Indian legislative practice in mind and, unless the context otherwise clearly requires, not to have conferred a legislative power intended to be interpreted in a sense not understood by those to whom the Act was to apply35F N Balsara ([1951] SCR 682 1951 Indlaw SC 63), in determining the meaning of the word  intoxicating liquor  in Entry 31 of List 11 of Sch36It is contended by the appellants quite rightly-that in interpreting the words of a Constitution the legislative practice relative thereto is not conclusiveMessrsBudh Prakash Jai Prakash ([1955] 1 SCR 243 1954 Indlaw SC 24), it was relied on for ascertaining the meaning and true scope of the very words which are now under consideration373839We shall examine these contentions seriatimThat is an argument open to the appellant, because rules of interpretation are only aids for ascertaining the true legislative intent and must yield to the context, where the contrary clearly appearsNow, what are the indications contra ?40Entry 31 is  Intoxicating liquors and narcotic drugs, that is to say, the production, manufacture, possession, transport, purchase and sale of intoxicating liquors, opium and other narcotic drugsBut this argument proceeds on a misapprehension of the principles on which the Entries are draftedThe scheme of the drafting is that there is in the beginning of the Entry words of general import, and they are followed by words having reference to particular aspects thereofThe operation of the general words, however, is not cut down by reason of the fact that there are sub-heads dealing with specific aspectsR S Nayudu ([1946] FCR 67, 84) occur the following observations pertinent to the present question : The subsequent words and phrases are not intended to limit the ambit of the opening general term or phrase but rather to illustrate the scope and objects of the legislation envisaged as comprised in the opening term or phrase41Entry 49 in List II2 of 19404243In Sydney Hydraulic and General Engineering Co vIn 1932, the Legislature intervened and enacted in the Statute of 1930, a new provision, s3(4), in the following terms: For the purpose of this Act, a person shall be deemed to have sold goods if, in the performance of any contract (not being a contract for the sale of goods) under which he has received, or is entitled to receive, valuable consideration, he supplies goods the property in which (whether as goods or in some other form) passes, under the terms of the contract, to some other person44After this, the question arose in M R Hornibrook (PtyThe majority of the Court held that he was3(4) of the ActNow, the

shew that the theory of the judgment in an action of detinue is that it is a kind of involuntary sale of the Plaintiffs goods to the Defendant47In Great Western Railway Co vCommissioners of Inland

exchange for their shares in the dissolved companies, in the case of one company, stock in the third company in certain specified proportions, and in the other, discharge of debentures on shares already held by them in the third companyIn rejecting this contention, Esher M R observed: Turning to the Stamp Act, the words used are  a conveyance on saleThe latter seems to me to be the meaning of the phrase as there used49Newcastle Breweries Ltd ([1927] 12 TC 927), the point for decision was whether payments made by the Admiralty to the respondent company which was carrying on business as brewers, on account of stocks of rum taken over by it compulsorily under the Defence of Realm Regulations were liable to be assessed as trade receipts to excess profits dutyIn rejecting this contention, Viscount Cave L C observed: If the raw rum had been voluntarily sold to other traders, the price must clearly have come into the computation of the Appellants profits, and the circumstance that the sale was compulsory and was to the Crown makes no difference in principle50John Hudson & Co Ltd ([1955] AC 696), the facts were that railway wagons belonging to the respondent company were taken over by the Transport Commission compulsorily in exercise of the powers conferred by s29 of the Transport Act, 1947, and compensation was paid thereforthe question whether it is a correct use of the English language to describe as a sale a transaction from which the element of mutual assent is missing is no doubt an interesting oneI think, however, that this question loses its importance for the purpose of the decision of this appeal when it is realized that for the last 100 years transactions by which the property of A has been transferred to B, Oil payment of compensation to the owner but without the consent of the owner, have been referred to many times, in Acts of Parliament, in opinions delivered in this House, in judgments of the Court of Appeal and the High Court of Justice, and in textbooks as a sale -generally as a compulsory sale- The case of Newcastle Breweries LdInland Revenue Commissioners ([1927] 96 LJKB735), referred to later, affords a striking modern instance of the use of the word I sale as applied to compulsory taking of goods  In these circumstances, whether this use of the word sale was originally correct or incorrect, I find it impossible to say that the only construction which can fairly be given to the word  sold  in s17(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1945, is to limit it to a transaction in which the element of mutual assent is present51But the majority of the House came to a different conclusion, and held that the element of bargain was essential to constitute a sale, and to describe compulsory taking over of property as a sale was a misuse of that word5215 of the Native Land Trust Ordinance, c86 of 1945, FijiThe decision, however, proceeded on the particular terms of the statute, and does not affect the decision in Kirkness v53It should be noted that the main ground on which the decision of Lord Morton rests is that compulsory acquisition of property had been described in the legislative practice of Great Britain as compulsory salesThe legislative practice of this country, however, has been differentPoppatlal Shah vThe United Motors (India) Ltd ([1953] SCR 1069 1953 Indlaw SC 97, 1078)It is unnecessary to discuss the other English cases cited above at any length, as the present question did not directly arise for decision therein, and the decision in Kirkness vJohn Hudson & Co Ld must be held to conclude the matter54To hold that there should be an agreement to sell the goods as such is, it is contended, to add to the Entry, words which are not there55We are unable to agree with this contentionWhere the goods delivered under the contract are not the goods contracted for, the purchaser has got a right to reject them, or to accept them and claim damages for breach of warrantyEdison Telephone Company of London ([1880] LR 6 QBD 244), Toronto Corporation vBell Telephone Company of Canada ([1905] AC 52), The Regulation and Control of Radio Communication in Canada, In re ([1932] AC 304) andBrislan: Ex Parte Williams ([1935] 54 CLR 262) were quoted as precedents for adopting such a constructionEdison Telephone Company of London (Supra), the question was whether the Edison Telephone Company, London, had infringed the exclusive privilege of transmitting telegrams granted to the Postmaster General under an Act of 1869 by installation of telephonesThe Court negatived this contention on the ground that the language of the definition was wide enough to include telephones92(10)(a) of the British North America Act, 1867, under which the Dominion Parliament had the exclusive competence to pass laws in respect of  lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs, and other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces or extending beyond the limits of the provinceThe question was whether a law incorporating a telephone company and conferring on it powers to enter upon streets and highways vested in a municipal corporation was intra vires the powers of the Dominion Parliament under the above provision, and whether in consequence a provision in an Ontario Act requiring the consent of the municipal authorities for the carrying out of those operations was ultra vires92(10)(a) and that, therefore, it prevailed over the Provincial Act56In The, Regulation and Control of Radio Communication in Canada, In re ([1932] AC 304), the question was whether broadcasting was covered by the expression telegraph and other works and undertakings  in sThe Privy Council answered it in the affirmative on the grounds, firstly, that broadcasting was an  undertaking connecting the province with other provinces and extending beyond the limits of the province and, secondly, that it fell within the description of telegraph Bristan: Ex Parte Williams ((1935) 54 CLR 262), the question was whether a law of the Commonwealth Parliament with respect to radio broadcasting was one with respect to  Postal, telegraphic, telephonic and other like services  under s51(5) of the Australian Commonwealth Act, and it was answered in the affirmative57The principle of these decisions is that when, after the enactment of a legislation, new facts and situations arise which could not have been in its contemplation, the statutory provisions could properly be applied to them if the words thereof are in a broad sense capable of containing themCommonwealth of Australia ([1936] AC 578 that the meaning of the words changes, but the changing circumstances illustrate and illuminate the full import of that meaningClearly, this principle has no application to the present case58Commercial Tax Officer (AIR 1957 Cal283 1957 Indlaw CAL 28) was relied on in support of this contention59107 can ariseThe decision in D Sarkar & BrosCommercial Tax Officer (AIR 1957 Cal283 1957 Indlaw CAL 28) on this point cannot beaccepted as sound60Atiqa Begum ([1940] FCR 110, 134) and Navinchandra Mafatlal vThe Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City ([1955] 1 SCR 829 1954 Indlaw SC 7061The nature and incidents of works contracts have been the subject of consideration in numerous decisions of the English courts, and there is a detailed consideration of the points now under discussion, in so far as building contracts, are concerned, in Hudson on Building Contracts,  and as regards chattels, in Benjamin on SaleIt is therefore sufficient to refer to the more important of the cases cited before usArmitage ((1839) 4 M & W 687 : 150 ER 1597), one Bennett, a builder, had entered into an agreement with certain trustees to build a hotelThe agreement provided inter alia that the articles which were to be used for the structure had to be approved by the trusteesSubsequently, Bennett became bankrupt, and the dispute was between his assignees in bankruptcy, and the trustees as regards title to certain wooden sash-frames which had been approved on behalf of the trustees but had not yet been fitted in the buildingThe trustees claimed them on the ground that property therein, had passed to them when once they had approved the sameIn negativing this contention, Lord Abinger C B observed: Parke B observed: but in this case, there is no contract at all with respect to these particular chattels-it is merely parcel of a larger contractThe contract is, that the bankrupt shall build a house that he shall make, amongst other things, window-frames for the house, and fix them in the house subject to the approbation of a surveyor and it was never intended by this contract, that the articles so to be fixed should become the property of the defendants, until they were fixed to the freehold62Bulmer ((1843) 11 M & W 243 : 152 ER 793), the plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant  to build an engine of 100 horse power for the sum of E 2,500, to be completed and fixed by the middle or end of December Different parts of the engine were constructed at the plaintiffs manufactory and sent in parts to the defendants colliery where they were fixed piecemeal and were made into an engineThe suit was for the recovery of a sum of E 3,000 as price for  a main engine and other goods sold and delivered In upholding this contention, Parke B observed : The engine was not contracted for to be delivered, or delivered, as an engine, in its complete state, and afterwards affixed to the freehold there was no sale of it, as an entire chattel, and delivery in that character and therefore it could not be treated as an engine sold and delivered63Moore ([1886] 11 AC 350), the facts were similar to those in Tripp vArmitage ((1839) 4 M & W 687 : 150 ER 1597)A firm of engineers, A Campbell & Son, had entered into five agreements with the appellants, T B Seath and Co, who were ship-builders to supply engines, boilers and machinery required for vessels to be built by themBefore the completion of the contracts, A Campbell & Son became bankrupt, and the dispute was as regards the title to machinery and other articles which were in the possession of the insolvents at the time of their bankruptcy but which had been made for the purpose of being fitted into the ships of the appellantsArmitage ((1839) 4 M & W 687 : 150 ER 1597) that there had been no sale of the machinery and parts as such, and that therefore they vested in the assigneeFor the appellant, reliance is placed on the following observations of Lord Watson: The English decisions to which I have referred appear to me to establish the principle that, where it appears to be the intention, or in other words the agreement, of the parties to a contract for building a, ship, that a particular stage of its construction, the vessel, so far as then finished, shall be appropriated to the contract of sale, the property of the vessel as soon as it has reached that stage of completion will pass to the purchaser, and subsequent additions made to the chattel thus vested in the purchaser will, accessione, become his property64That appears to me to have been matter of direct decision by the Court of Exchequer Chamber in Wood vBell ((1856) 6 E & B 355 : 119 ER 669)Russell ((1822) 5 B & Al65Macbeth & Gray ([1904] AC 223), the facts were that a firm of ship-builders who had agreed to build a ship became bankrupt6667Norman Wright (Builders) Ld69707172737475104 of the Act7677\n"}

1946-47The Judgment was delivered by : P B Gajendragadkar, J 1A)The schedule attached to the plaint describes the properties covered by the will under five itemsFirst three items in the schedule refer respectively to 5, 4 and 4 agricultural lands at Hampapura village, whereas the fourth item includes 9 lands at Arjunahalli village and the last item is vacant site in Hampapura village2,106 which had been collected by respondent 1 by way of income from the suit lands and a further prayer was made for the payment of current mesne profits by respondent 12One Annaji lyengar who died in July 1903 left behind him his adopted son, the appellant, and two daughters Gundamma alias Ranganayakamma who is still alive and Lakshmamma alias Achamma who is alleged to have executed the will in suit and died thereafter on September 26, 1945, at MandyaLakshmamma was married to Sadagopalachar who died in December 1908The couple had three children, a son named Narayana lyengar who died on January 14, 1944, without any issue and left behind him his widow respondent 1; and the two remaining children of Lakshmamma were daughters Thirumalamma and YadugirammaBoth of them are deadThirumalamma was married to one G Parthasarathy lyengar by whom she had a son of weak intellect, who died pending litigation, and three daughters Neelu, Jaya and PadminiYadugiramma was married to Kalbagal Garudachar and by him she had a son Narasimha lyengar, respondent 5, and daughter LillyKalbagal Garudachar had a son S G Kalbagal, (hereinafter described as Junior Kalbagal) from his first wifeJaya was married to Kalbagal Junior3D)10,320 as gift with the express stipulation that the survivor of the legatees should take the whole of the bequest by survivorshipThe appellant alleged that Sadagopalachar was a man of very moderate means and had given up his petty job in the registration department in order to manage the properties received by him and his wife from Annaji lyengarDuring the course of the management Sadagopalachar used the cash of Rs10,320 received by bequest under the will of Annaji lyengar to buy some immoveable properties including items 3 and 4Since Sadagopalachar pre-deceased his wife Lakshmamma, all his rights in the properties acquired under the gift deed as well as those subsequently purchased devolved on Lakshmamma alone by survivorshipor a declaration in that behalf and consequential reliefs so as to give effect to the terms and dispositions of the will410,320 under itD) did not provide for devolution of interest by survivorship; she pleaded that Lakshmamma had transferred all her interests in the properties comprised in the gift deed in favour of her husband Sadagopalachar who then became their sole ownerShe contended that the will had been brought into existence through the machinations of the appellant and she disputed the appellants right to bring the present suit5On these pleadings the learned trial judge framed fifteen issuesD) which was held to be genuine and validF)vested in his fatherA) was genuine and valid to the extent of the share belonging to the testatrixThe learned judge also found that the suit was maintainable, was not barred by time and had been properly filed61,050 out of the past mesne profits recovered by herAn enquiry into future mesne profits was also directed under 0XX, r127In the result the appeal preferred by respondent I was allowed, the cross-objections filed by the appellant were rejected and his suit was dismissed820,0009She usually resided at Hampapur; but about a month before the executing of the will she had gone to Mandya to attend the marriage in the house of Junior KalbagalAfter the marriage was over she would normally have returned to Hampapur but she fell ill and had to extend her stay with Junior KalbagalHe then went to Mandya by the morning train on August 22, 1945, and the will was got written about 11 or 11-30 amThe will was then read out to her and was signed by her in five places (ExsA-1 to A-5)W 1) and Narasimha Iyengar (PW 2)Some time later during the course of the day the Sub-Registrar came to the house of Junior Kalbagal and in his 55 presence the will (ExA) was duly registered10The will is a fairly long document and its English translation spreads over eight printed pagesThe will begins with the recital about the illness of the testatrix and says as I have felt in my mind that it is necessary to mention here certain matters clearly so that there may not be any kind of obstacles and obstruction at the instance of any in respect of my purposes coming into effect after my death I have got them written in detail10,000 were bequeathed to both of themThe will then refers to the fact that Sadagopalachar was possessed of only a house and a carriage shed and owned no other ancestral propertyEven the said house was of very ancient times and was in a dilapidated conditionAccording to the will Sadagopalachar held a small government job which he resigned in order to live in Hampapur and to look after the property obtained by gift from AnnajiIt was my opinion, says the will, that he was probably looking after my share of the property in addition to his own and was improving the sameIt is but natural to think in this manner mutually in respect of husband and wifeIt says that during Narayanans minority the testatrix sold some properties at the advice and with the help of her Brother-in-law Srinivasa lyengar for debts without considering whether it was my share or my husbands share; shealso sold gold and diamond ornaments to meet the urgent needs of the familyAfter Narayanan became a major he began to manage the property in constitution with Srinivasa lyengarNarayanan wanted to build a house for residence in Mysore and so he sold some wet lands situated at Sarvamanya Gaudhanahalli villageNarayanan had no issue and so he spent generously at the time of the marriage of the three daughters of his younger sister ThirumalammaBesides he got ornaments prepared moderately for all of them and purchased and gave them as pin money some wet lands situated at Arjunahalli villageNarayanan purchased and gave some wet lands at the same village to the son of his second younger sister Kalbagal Narasimha Iyengar and to Singamma and LalithammaThe will then states that Narayanan had no issue and so he treated his younger sisters children as his own, attended to their education, marriage and other auspicious functions with great zeal114,000 which was paid to respondent 1 on Narayanans death; and in regard to Narayanans illness which ultimately resulted in his death the will adds that the testatrix herself had provided separate money for his medicinal and family expenses and that she had given Narayanan Rs3,000 which had been deposited with her Brother-in-law and the Reserve Bank share of Rs500 to enable him to purchase a house at MysoreExcept me, says the will, no one has any right whatever to the scheduled propertiesThey should go only to those for whom it is intended here according to my desire after my death but there is no reason whatsoever for their going to my agnates or any othersI am at full liberty to make dispositions hereby according to my desire12She shall have no right such as hypothecation, sale, gift, exchange, etc, of the said properties nor has she any right whatever to create liability in any way in favour of othersRespondent 5 is described as an heir by the testatrix after her death and has been authorised to perform all her ceremoniesOut of the 15 acres of land included in item 4, the bequest in regard to 9 acres is burdened with a charge in favour of certain legacies and charities mentioned in the willThe recipients of the legacies who are the relatives of the testatrix are named, and the charities are also specifically mentioned500 each have to be paid to her eldest daughters third daughter Padminiamma, to her eldest daughters son Thirumalachar and to Sudhakalyani, the daughter of her eldest daughters second daughter Jaya and to Nagendra, son of Neelamma, the eldest daughter of her eldest daughter1,000 had to be used for conducting service in the Sannadi of Lakshminarayanaswamy at Hampapur on the respective dates of death of her husband, her son and herself500 has to be endowed for the Nandadipa service in the name of Narayanan in the Sannadi of Thirupati Venkataramanaswami, and Rs500 for similar service in the name of Sadagopalachar in the Sannadi of Channakeshavaswami, Belur, the place of the family in Hassan District131,000 has to be utilised for scholarship to poor students5,000 have to be spent for these legacies and charitiesThe will directs that if respondents 2 to 4 fail to make these payments within three years after the death of the testatrix the appellant who is appointed the executor under the will should, after the expiry of the said three years, sell for reasonable price the lands charged in that behalf and should pay the full amount realised by such sale to carry out the aforesaid charitable works and to give effect to the legacies mentioned in the willThe will then repeats the averment about the title of the testatrix and states that when Narayana Iyengar was alive he had sold about 17 acres of land situate at Adagur and other places for purchasing lands at Arjunahalli village for his sisters children and so the testatrix had full liberty to make a disposition in respect of the scheduled properties which were her ownThese are the broad features, and dispositions, of the will in question1415Mr Krishnamurthy Rao (PW 1) was a medical officer to the Mysore Sugar Company, Mandya, and he knew the Junior Kulbagal who was working as a Cane Superintendent in the said factoryThis witness was called by Kalbagal to attest the will and so he went to his house and saw that Lakshmamma was lying in her bed since she had an attack of paralysis on her left sideThe witness was cross-examined in regard to his statement that he had treated Lakshmamma and it was brought out in his answers that though she may have been under his treatment for about a week he could not say if her name found a place in the hospital registerHe, however, added that even patients who are treated in their houses would be mentioned in the hospital register if they come and take medicine from the hospitalWhen the witness was asked about the details of his signature on the will he gave answers which showed that he did not have any clear recollection as to what happened on that dateIt fact some of his answers suggest that the witness did not even remember that he was present when the Sub-Registrar arrived and registered the document16W 2)He was employed in Mandya Sugar Company Distillery1718Chokkanna (PW 3) the scribe is a relative of KulbagalThe mother of Chokkanna and Kulbagals mother are sistersHe heard about her intention to execute the will about 9 amin the morning19His father Kalbagal Garudachar and his wife Jaya were also presentm20m21A - I to A-5 are those of Lakshmamma22A was rejected by the learned judge and he observed that when it is proved-that ExsA, it is to be presumed that the testatrix had the knowledge of the contents of the will23The High Court, on the other hand, has taken a contrary view24What is the true legal position in the matter of proof of wills ?It is well-known that the proof of wills presents a recurring topic for decision in courts and there are a large number of judicial pronouncements on the subjectSections 67 and 68 of the Evidence Act are relevant for this purposeUnder s45 and 47 of the Act the opinions of experts and of persons acquainted with the handwriting of the person concerned are made relevantSimilarly, ss59 and 63 of the Indian Succession Act are also relevantSection 59 provides that every person of sound mind, not being a minor, may dispose of his property by will and the three illustrations to this section indicate what is meant by the expression a person of sound mind in the context2563 of the Indian Succession ActThe test to be applied would be the usual test of the satisfaction of the, prudent mind in such mattersHowever, there is one important feature which distinguishes wills from other documentsUnlike other documents the will speaks from the death of the testator, and so, when it is propounded or produced before a court, the testator who has already departed the world cannot say whether it is his will or not; and this aspect naturally introduces an element of solemnity in the decision of the question as to whether the document-propounded is proved to be the last will and testament of the departed testatorIn other words, the onus on the propounder can be taken to be discharged on proof of the essential facts just indicated26It is true that, if a caveat is filed alleging the exercise of undue influence, fraud or coercion in respect of the execution of the will propounded, such pleas may have to be proved by the caveators; but, even without such pleas circumstances may raise a doubt as to whether the testator was acting of his own free will in executing the will, and in such circumstances, it would be a part of the initial onus to remove any such legitimate doubts in the matterApart from the suspicious circumstances to which we have just referred, in some cases the wills propounded disclose another infirmityIt may be that the reference to judicial conscience in this connection is a heritage from similar observations made by ecclesiastical courts in England when they exercised jurisdiction with reference to wills; but any objection to the use of the word conscience in this context would, in our opinion, be purely technical and academic, if not pedantic27It is obvious that for deciding material questions of fact which arise in applications for probate or in actions on wills, no hard and fast or inflexible rules can be laid down for the appreciation of the evidenceIt is quite true that, as observed by Lord Du Parcq in Harmes vHinkson ((1946) 50 CWN 895) where a will is charged with suspicion, the rules enjoin a reasonable scepticism, not an obdurate persistence in disbeliefThey do not demand from the judge, even in circumstances of grave suspicion, a resolute and impenetrable incredulityHe is never required to close his mind to the truthIt would sound platitudinous to say so, but it is nevertheless true that in discovering truth even in such cases the judicial mind must always be open though vigilant, cautious and circumspect28It is true she A, as an old woman of 64 years and had been ailing for some time before the will was executedShe was not able to get up and leave the bedIn fact she could sit up in bed with some difficulty and was so weak that she had to pass stools in bedMr Iyengar, for the appellant, has strongly urged before us that, since these facts are established, the court must presume the valid execution of the will and in support of his contention he has invited our attention to the relevant statements on the point in the text books dealing with the subjectJarman on Wills (Jarman on Wills--Vol1, 8th Ed, P 50) says that the general rule is that the onus probandi lies in every case upon the party propounding a will and he must satisfy the conscience of the court that the instrument so propounded is the last will of a free and capable testator He adds that, if a will is rational on the face of it, and appears to be duly executed, it is presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be validSimilarly, Williams on Executors and Administrators (Williams on Executors and Administrators--Vol1, 13th Ed, P 92) has observed that, generally speaking, where there is proof of signature, everything else is implied till the contrary is proved; and evidence of the will having been read over to the testator or of instructions having been given is not necessary On the other hand, Mr Viswanatha Sastri, for respondent NoIn this connection, it may be pertinent to point out that, in the same text books, we find another rule specifically mentionedAlthough the rule of Roman Law, it is observed in Williams, that Qui se scripsit haeredem could take no benefit under a will does not prevail in the law of England, yet, where the person who prepares the instrument, or conducts its execution, is himself benefited by its dispositions, that is a circumstance which ought generally to excite the suspicion of the court, and calls on it to be vigilant and zealous in examining the evidence in support of the instrument in favour of which it ought not to pronounce, unless the suspicion is removed, and it is judicially satisfied that the paper does express the true will of the deceased (Williams on Executors and Administrators, Vol1, 13th Ed, P 93)29Does the will appear to be on the whole an improbable, unnatural and unfair instrument as held by the High Court?That is the first question which falls to be consideredWe have already indicated that the preamble to the will contains many argumentative recitalsD) devolved upon her by survivorship after her husbands death, a plea which has not been accepted even by the trial courtIt sets out in detail the theory that the son of the testatrix has lost his right, title and interest in the properties which devolved on him after his fathers death because he had alienated more than his share in the said properties during his lifetime; and it even suggests that during his illness and to help him to build a house in Mysore the testatrix had advanced him money from her separate funds, pleas which have not been accepted by either court belowIn the context these recitals sound artificial and unnatural and some of them at any rate are untrueThe draftsman of the will has tried to be overwise and that itself is a very serious infirmity in the appellants case that the instrument represents the last will and testament of the testatrix30It was sent by cheque on Mysore Bank31The next circumstance which calls for an explanation is the exclusion of the grand-children of the testtatrix from any substantial legacies under the will500 each is given to them but that can hardly be regarded as fair or just to these childrenIt was, however, urged by Mr lyengar before us that Narayana lyengar had, during his lifetime, given lands to his sisters daughtersHe had also spent considerable amounts on the occasion of their marriages and had given them each valuable ornamentsIn this connection, he referred us to certain documents exhibited under ExI G and attempted to show that the lands given to his sisters daughters were of the value of Rs1,500 to Rs2,000 eachIt is not suggested-that the relations between the testatrix and these grand-children were not cordial and affectionate and so it would be reasonable to assume that they would have been the objects of her bounties in a more liberal measure in ordinary circumstances32Indeed the appellant admitted that, at the relevant time, he was in straightened circumstances and was indebted to the extent of nearly, Rs30,000 and it does not appear that when he was faced with financial difficulties of this magnitude he asked for or obtained any assistance from his adoptive sisterWe cannot easily reject the argument urged onWe do not propose to measure precisely the value of the properties bequeathed to the appellants sonsIt would be enough to say that the said bequests are by no means insignificant or unsubstantial33Thus, the very important, if not the decisive, part played by the appellant in the execution of the will cannot at all be disputed in the present case34Andrew (1874-75) LR 7 HL 448  those who take a benefit under a will, and have been instrumental in preparing or obtaining it, have thrown upon them the onus of showing the righteousness of the transactionThere is however no unyielding rule of law (especially where the ingredient of fraud enters into the case) that, when it has been proved that a testator, competent in mind, has had a will read over to him, and has thereupon executed it, all further enquiry is shut outIn this case, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cairns, has cited with approval the well-known observations of Baron Parke in the case of Barry vButlin [1838] 2 MooPC 480 : 12 ER 1089 , 48235It is hardly necessary to add that the statement of these two rules has now attained the status of a classic on the subject and it is cited by all text books on willsIt was tried on six issuesThe sixth was whether the testator knew and approved of the residuary clause; and by this last clause the propounders of the will were made the residuary legatees and were appointed executorsThe jurors found in favour of the propounders on the first five issues and in favour of the opponents oil the sixthIt appears that no leave to set aside the verdict and enter judgment for the propounders notwithstanding the verdict on the sixth issue was reserved; but when the case came before the Court of Probate a rule was obtained to set aside the verdict generally and have a new trial or to set aside the verdict on the sixth issue for misdirectionIt was in dealing with the merits of the finding on the sixth issue that the true legal position came to be considered by the House of Lords36The same principle was emphasized by the Privy Council in Vellasawmy Servai vSivaraman Servai (1929) LR 57 IA 961929 IndLaw PC 4237In Sarat Kumari Bibi vThis view is supported by the observations made by Lindley and Davey, L JJPainton [1894] P 1511928 IndLaw PC 31, 157, 159Butlin [1838] 2 MooP C 480 : 12 ER 1089 , 482Andrew (1874-75) LR 7 HL 448  and Brown vFisher (1890) 63 LT 465, said Lindley, L J, is not in my mind confined to the single case in which the will is prepared by or on the instructions of the person taking large benefits under it but extends to all cases in which circumstances exist which excite the suspicions of the court38In Rash Mohini Dasi vUmesh Chunder Biswas (1898) LR 25 IA 1091898 IndLaw PC 28 it appeared that though the will was fairly simple and not very long the making of it was from first to

suit lands and a further prayer was made for the payment of current mesne profits by respondent 12One Annaji lyengar who died in July 1903 left behind him his adopted son, the appellant, and two daughters Gundamma alias Ranganayakamma who is still alive and Lakshmamma alias Achamma who is alleged to have executed the will in suit and died thereafter on September 26, 1945, at MandyaLakshmamma

of weak intellect, who died pending litigation, and three daughters Neelu, Jaya and PadminiYadugiramma was married to Kalbagal Garudachar and by him she had a son Narasimha lyengar, respondent 5, and daughter LillyKalbagal Garudachar had a son S G Kalbagal, (hereinafter described as Junior Kalbagal) from his first wifeJaya was married to Kalbagal Junior3D)10,320 as gift with the express stipulation that the survivor of the legatees should take the whole of the bequest by survivorshipThe appellant alleged that Sadagopalachar was a man of very moderate means and had given up his petty job in the registration department in order to manage the properties received by him and his wife from Annaji lyengarDuring the course of the management Sadagopalachar used the cash of Rs10,320 received by bequest under the will of Annaji lyengar to buy some immoveable properties including items 3 and 4Since Sadagopalachar pre-deceased his wife Lakshmamma, all his rights in the properties

and she disputed the appellants right to bring the present suit5On these pleadings the learned trial judge framed fifteen issuesD) which was held to be genuine and validF)vested in his fatherA) was genuine and valid to the extent of the share belonging to the testatrixThe learned judge also found that the suit was maintainable, was not barred by time and had been properly filed61,050 out of the past mesne profits recovered by herAn enquiry into future mesne profits was also directed under 0XX, r127In the result the appeal preferred by respondent I was allowed, the cross-objections filed by the appellant were rejected and his suit was dismissed820,0009She usually resided at Hampapur but about a month before the executing of the will she had gone to Mandya to attend the marriage in the house of Junior KalbagalAfter the marriage was over she would normally have returned to Hampapur but she fell ill and had to extend her stay with Junior KalbagalHe then went to Mandya by the morning train on August 22, 1945, and the will was got written about 11 or 11-30 amThe will was then read out to her and was signed by her in five places (ExsA-1 to A-5)W 1) and Narasimha Iyengar (PW 2)Some time later during the course of the day the Sub-Registrar came to the house of Junior Kalbagal and in his 55 presence the will (ExA) was duly registered10The will is a fairly long document and its English translation spreads over eight printed pagesThe will begins with the recital about the illness of the testatrix and says as I have felt in my mind that it is necessary to mention here certain matters clearly so that there may not be any kind of obstacles and obstruction at the instance of any in respect of my purposes coming into effect after my death I have got them written in detail10,000 were bequeathed to both of themThe will then refers to the fact that Sadagopalachar was possessed of only a house and a carriage shed and owned no other ancestral propertyEven the said house was of very ancient times and was in a dilapidated conditionAccording to the will Sadagopalachar held a small government job which he resigned in order to live in Hampapur and to look after the property obtained by gift from AnnajiIt was my opinion, says the will, that he was probably looking after my share of the property in addition to his own and was improving the sameIt is but natural to think in this manner mutually in respect of husband and wifeIt says that during Narayanans minority the testatrix sold some properties at the advice and with the help of her Brother-in-law Srinivasa lyengar for debts without considering whether it was my share or my husbands share shealso sold gold and diamond ornaments to meet the urgent needs of the familyAfter Narayanan became a major he began to manage the property in constitution with Srinivasa lyengarNarayanan wanted to build a house for residence in Mysore and so he sold some wet lands situated at Sarvamanya Gaudhanahalli villageNarayanan had no issue and so he spent generously at the time of the marriage of the three daughters of his younger sister ThirumalammaBesides he got ornaments prepared moderately for all of them and purchased and gave them as pin money some wet lands situated at Arjunahalli villageNarayanan purchased and gave some wet lands at the same village to the son of his second younger sister Kalbagal Narasimha Iyengar and to Singamma and LalithammaThe will then states that Narayanan had no issue and so he treated his younger sisters children as his own, attended to their education, marriage and other auspicious functions with great zeal114,000 which was paid to respondent 1 on Narayanans death and in regard to Narayanans illness which ultimately resulted in his death the will adds that the testatrix herself had provided separate money for his medicinal and family expenses and that she had given Narayanan Rs3,000 which had been deposited with her Brother-in-law and the Reserve Bank share of Rs500 to enable him to purchase a house at MysoreExcept me, says the will, no one has any right whatever to the scheduled propertiesThey should go only to those for whom it is intended here according to my desire after my death but there is no reason whatsoever for their going to my agnates or any othersI am at full liberty to make dispositions hereby according to my desire12She shall have no right such as hypothecation, sale, gift, exchange, etc, of the said properties nor has she any right whatever to create liability in any way in favour of othersRespondent 5 is described as an heir by the testatrix after her death and has been authorised to perform all her ceremoniesOut of the 15 acres of land included in item 4, the bequest in regard to 9 acres is burdened with a charge in favour of certain legacies and charities mentioned in the willThe recipients of the legacies who are the relatives of the testatrix are named, and the charities are also specifically mentioned500 each have to be paid to her eldest daughters third daughter Padminiamma, to her eldest daughters son Thirumalachar and to Sudhakalyani, the daughter of her eldest daughters second daughter Jaya and to Nagendra, son of Neelamma, the eldest daughter of her eldest daughter1,000 had to be used for conducting service in the Sannadi of Lakshminarayanaswamy at Hampapur on the respective dates of death of her husband, her son and herself500 has to be endowed for the Nandadipa service in the name of Narayanan in the Sannadi of Thirupati Venkataramanaswami, and Rs500 for similar service in the name of Sadagopalachar in the Sannadi of Channakeshavaswami, Belur, the place of the family in Hassan District131,000 has to be utilised for scholarship to poor students5,000 have to be spent for these legacies and charitiesThe will directs that if respondents 2 to 4 fail to make these payments within three years after the death of the testatrix the appellant who is appointed the executor under the will should, after the expiry of the said three years, sell for reasonable price the lands charged in that behalf and should pay the full amount realised by such sale to carry out the aforesaid charitable works and to give effect to the legacies mentioned in the willThe will then repeats the averment about the title of the testatrix and states that when Narayana Iyengar was alive he had sold about 17 acres of land situate at Adagur and other places for purchasing lands at Arjunahalli village for his sisters children and so the testatrix had full liberty to make a disposition in respect of the scheduled properties which were her ownThese are the broad features, and dispositions, of the will in question1415Mr Krishnamurthy Rao (PW 1) was a medical officer to the Mysore Sugar Company, Mandya, and he knew the Junior Kulbagal who was working as a Cane Superintendent in the said factoryThis witness was called by Kalbagal to attest the will and so he went to his house and saw that Lakshmamma was lying in her bed since she had an attack of paralysis on her left sideThe witness was cross-examined in regard to his statement that he had treated Lakshmamma and it was brought out in his answers that though she may have been under his treatment for about a week he could not say if her name found a place in the hospital registerHe, however, added that even patients who are treated in their houses would be mentioned in the hospital register if they come and take medicine from the hospitalWhen the witness was asked about the details of his signature on the will he gave answers which showed that he did not have any clear recollection as to what happened on that dateIt fact some of his answers suggest that the witness did not even remember that he was present when the Sub-Registrar arrived and registered the document16W 2)He was employed in Mandya Sugar Company Distillery1718Chokkanna (PW 3) the scribe is a relative of KulbagalThe mother of Chokkanna and Kulbagals mother are sistersHe heard about her intention to execute the will about 9 amin the morning19His father Kalbagal Garudachar and his wife Jaya were also presentm20m21A - I to A-5 are those of Lakshmamma22A was rejected by the learned judge and he observed that when it is proved-that ExsA, it is to be presumed that the testatrix had the knowledge of the contents of the will23The High Court, on the other hand, has taken a contrary view24What is the true legal position in the matter of proof of wills ?It is well-known that the proof of wills presents a recurring topic for decision in courts and there are a large number of judicial pronouncements on the subjectSections 67 and 68 of the Evidence Act are relevant for this purposeUnder s45 and 47 of the Act the opinions of experts and of persons acquainted with the handwriting of the person concerned are made relevantSimilarly, ss59 and 63 of the Indian Succession Act are also relevantSection 59 provides that every person of sound mind, not being a minor, may dispose of his property by will and the three illustrations to this section indicate what is meant by the expression a person of sound mind in the context2563 of the Indian Succession ActThe test to be applied would be the usual test of the satisfaction of the, prudent mind in such mattersHowever, there is one important feature which distinguishes wills from other documentsUnlike other documents the will speaks from the death of the testator, and so, when it is propounded or produced before a court, the testator who has already departed the world cannot say whether it is his will or not and this aspect naturally introduces an element of solemnity in the decision of the question as to whether the document-propounded is proved to be the last will and testament of the departed testatorIn other words, the onus on the propounder can be taken to be discharged on proof of the essential facts just indicated26It is true that, if a caveat is filed alleging the exercise of undue influence, fraud or coercion in respect of the execution of the will propounded, such pleas may have to be proved by the caveators but, even without such pleas circumstances may raise a doubt as to whether the testator was acting of his own free will in executing the will, and in such circumstances, it would be a part of the initial onus to remove any such legitimate doubts in the matterApart from the suspicious circumstances to which we have just referred, in some cases the wills propounded disclose another infirmityIt may be that the reference to judicial conscience in this connection is a heritage from similar observations made by ecclesiastical courts in England when they exercised jurisdiction with reference to wills but any objection to the use of the word conscience in this context would, in our opinion, be purely technical and academic, if not pedantic27It is obvious that for deciding material questions of fact which arise in applications for probate or in actions on wills, no hard and fast or inflexible rules can be laid down for the appreciation of the evidenceIt is quite true that, as observed by Lord Du Parcq in Harmes vHinkson ((1946) 50 CWN 895) where a will is charged with suspicion, the rules enjoin a reasonable scepticism, not an obdurate persistence in disbeliefThey do not demand from the judge, even in circumstances of grave suspicion, a resolute and impenetrable incredulityHe is never required to close his mind to the truthIt would sound platitudinous to say so, but it is nevertheless true that in discovering truth even in such cases the judicial mind must always be open though vigilant, cautious and circumspect28It is true she A, as an old woman of 64 years and had been ailing for some time before the will was executedShe was not able to get up and leave the bedIn fact she could sit up in bed with some difficulty and was so weak that she had to pass stools in bedMr Iyengar, for the appellant, has strongly urged before us that, since these facts are established, the court must presume the valid execution of the will and in support of his contention he has invited our attention to the relevant statements on the point in the text books dealing with the subjectJarman on Wills (Jarman on Wills--Vol1, 8th Ed, P 50) says that the general rule is that the onus probandi lies in every case upon the party propounding a will and he must satisfy the conscience of the court that the instrument so propounded is the last will of a free and capable testator He adds that, if a will is rational on the face of it, and appears to be duly executed, it is presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be validSimilarly, Williams on Executors and Administrators (Williams on Executors and Administrators--Vol1, 13th Ed, P 92) has observed that, generally speaking, where there is proof of signature, everything else is implied till the contrary is proved and evidence of the will having been read over to the testator or of instructions having been given is not necessary On the other hand, Mr Viswanatha Sastri, for respondent NoIn this connection, it may be pertinent to point out that, in the same text books, we find another rule specifically mentionedAlthough the rule of Roman Law, it is observed in Williams, that Qui se scripsit haeredem could take no benefit under a will does not prevail in the law of England, yet, where the person who prepares the instrument, or conducts its execution, is himself benefited by its dispositions, that is a circumstance which ought generally to excite the suspicion of the court, and calls on it to be vigilant and zealous in examining the evidence in support of the instrument in favour of which it ought not to pronounce, unless the suspicion is removed, and it is judicially satisfied that the paper does express the true will of the deceased (Williams on Executors and Administrators, Vol1, 13th Ed, P 93)29Does the will appear to be on the whole an improbable, unnatural and unfair instrument as held by the High Court?That is the first question which falls to be consideredWe have already indicated that the preamble to the will contains many argumentative recitalsD) devolved upon her by survivorship after her husbands death, a plea which has not been accepted even by the trial courtIt sets out in detail the theory that the son of the testatrix has lost his right, title and interest in the properties which devolved on him after his fathers death because he had alienated more than his share in the said properties during his lifetime and it even suggests that during his illness and to help him to build a house in Mysore the testatrix had advanced him money from her separate funds, pleas which have not been accepted by either court belowIn the context these recitals sound artificial and unnatural and some of them at any rate are untrueThe draftsman of the will has tried to be overwise and that itself is a very serious infirmity in the appellants case that the instrument represents the last will and testament of the testatrix30It was sent by cheque on Mysore Bank31The next circumstance which calls for an explanation is the exclusion of the grand-children of the testtatrix from any substantial legacies under the will500 each is given to them but that can hardly be regarded as fair or just to these childrenIt was, however, urged by Mr lyengar before us that Narayana lyengar had, during his lifetime, given lands to his sisters daughtersHe had also spent considerable amounts on the occasion of their marriages and had given them each valuable ornamentsIn this connection, he referred us to certain documents exhibited under ExI G and attempted to show that the lands given to his sisters daughters were of the value of Rs1,500 to Rs2,000 eachIt is not suggested-that the relations between the testatrix and these grand-children were not cordial and affectionate and so it would be reasonable to assume that they would have been the objects of her bounties in a more liberal measure in ordinary circumstances32Indeed the appellant admitted that, at the relevant time, he was in straightened circumstances and was indebted to the extent of nearly, Rs30,000 and it does not appear that when he was faced with financial difficulties of this magnitude he asked for or obtained any assistance from his adoptive sisterWe cannot easily reject the argument urged onWe do not propose to measure precisely the value of the properties bequeathed to the appellants sonsIt would be enough to say that the said bequests are by no means insignificant or unsubstantial33Thus, the very important, if not the decisive, part played by the appellant in the execution of the will cannot at all be disputed in the present case34Andrew (1874-75) LR 7 HL 448  those who take a benefit under a will, and have been instrumental in preparing or obtaining it, have thrown upon them the onus of showing the righteousness of the transactionThere is however no unyielding rule of law (especially where the ingredient of fraud enters into the case) that, when it has been proved that a testator, competent in mind, has had a will read over to him, and has thereupon executed it, all further enquiry is shut outIn this case, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cairns, has cited with approval the well-known observations of Baron Parke in the case of Barry vButlin [1838] 2 MooPC 480 : 12 ER 1089 , 48235It is hardly necessary to add that the statement of these two rules has now attained the status of a classic on the subject and it is cited by all text books on willsIt was tried on six issuesThe sixth was whether the testator knew and approved of the residuary clause and by this last clause the propounders of the will were made the residuary legatees and were appointed executorsThe jurors found in favour of the propounders on the first five issues and in favour of the opponents oil the sixthIt appears that no leave to set aside the verdict and enter judgment for the propounders notwithstanding the verdict on the sixth issue was reserved but when the case came before the Court of Probate a rule was obtained to set aside the verdict generally and have a new trial or to set aside the verdict on the sixth issue for misdirectionIt was in dealing with the merits of the finding on the sixth issue that the true legal position came to be considered by the House of Lords36The same principle was emphasized by the Privy Council in Vellasawmy Servai vSivaraman Servai (1929) LR 57 IA 961929 IndLaw PC 4237In Sarat Kumari Bibi vThis view is supported by the observations made by Lindley and Davey, L JJPainton [1894] P 1511928 IndLaw PC 31, 157, 159Butlin [1838] 2 MooP C 480 : 12 ER 1089 , 482Andrew (1874-75) LR 7 HL 448  and Brown vFisher (1890) 63 LT 465, said Lindley, L J, is not in my mind confined to the single case in which the will is prepared by or on the instructions of the person taking large benefits under it but extends to all cases in which circumstances exist which excite the suspicions of the court38In Rash Mohini Dasi vUmesh Chunder Biswas (1898) LR 25 IA 1091898 IndLaw PC 28 it appeared that though the will was fairly simple and not very long the making of it was from first to last the doing of Khetter, the manager and trusted adviser of the alleged testatorNo previous or independent intention of making a will was shown and the, evidence that the testator understood the business in which his adviser engaged him was not sufficient to justify the-grant of probate39Khettromoni Dasi (1899) ILR 27 CalHe and three others were appointed executors of the willBy his will the adopted son obtained substantial benefitPainton [1894] P 151, 157, 159In

ownershipIn our opinion it is not unlikely that these fire-arms being in possession of the prosecution witnesses, were produced at the Police Station in order to avoid a prosecution on account of possessing unlicensed fire-armsHaving once produced them before the police, the witnesses had to give some explanation regarding them, and the explanation that would suggest ordinarily would be to attribute the fire arms to the accuseds partyThat they had time to invent such a story is clear from the fact that the journey to the Police Station took nearly 1 1/2 hours and during that period Mohindar Singh (PW19) could certainly have invented the story22We do not think that the three pursued individuals who, according to the evidence, were not at a short distance, would have had sufficient courage to turn round and attack the pursuers, especially when they knew that the pursuers had firearms in their handsIt is also unlikely that the pursued individuals knew that the fire-arms could not be used again effectivelyIn these circumstances, the story of the snatching of the fire-arms seems to be artificial and was probably invented to hide the unlawful possession of the fire-armsWe, therefore, reject the prosecution version regarding this and in our opinion it is just likely that the pistol and the gun belonged to the witnesses themselves23It seems to us that that attempt is futileWhat must have happened was that both the parties being armed when they came into conflict, weapons must have been used by the prosecution witnesses also on the accuseddoubt whatever that in such an encounter it is the three deceased that got worsted when injuries were inflicted on them24He analyses the attack in different stagesThe first stage was when the parties metThe second stage was when one or more of the assailants inflicted injuries on the deceased and the third stage nextIf these witnesses had stated the portions of the body on which such injuries were inflicted, then probably their evidence could have been branded as unbelievable but that having not been done, the learned counsel contends that the evidence of those witnesses can be accepted252619 to 21 to the extent to which the injuries said to have been inflicted by them were found27In such a case where a mutual conflict develops and there is noreliable and acceptable evidence as to how it started and as to who was the aggressor, would it be correct to assume private defence for both sides?We are of the view that such a situation does not permit of the plea of private defence on either side and would be a case of sudden fight and conflict and has to be dealt with under S 300, IPC, Exception 428The matter has to be viewed in this waypremeditation and therefore when the contending factions met

Bhuvaneshwar Prasad Sinha, J 1This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment and decree of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated August 22,1952, reversing those of a single Judge of that Court on the Original Side, dated March 7,1952, by which he had granted a decree for dissolution of marriage between the appellant and the respondent2The facts and circumstances of this case may be stated as follows: The appellant, who was the plaintiff, and the respondent were married at Patan on April 20, 1942, according to Hindu rites of the Jain CommunityThe families of both the parties belong to Patan, which is a town in Gujarat, about a nights rail journey from BombayThey lived in Bombay in a two-room flat which was in occupation of the appellants family consisting of his parents and his two sisters, who occupied the larger room called the hall, and the plaintiff and the defendant who occupied the smaller room called the kitchenThe appellants mother who is a patient of asthma lived mostly at PatanThere is an issue of the marriage, a son named Kirit, born on September 10, 1945The defendants parents lived mostly at Jaigaon in the East Khandesh district in BombayThe parties appear to have lived happily in Bombay until a third party named Mahendra, a friend of the family came upon the scene and began to live with the family in their Bombay flat some time in 1946, after his discharge from the armyOn January 8, 1947, the appellant left for England on businessE as officially translated in English, the original being in Gujerati except a few words written in faulty English3This letter had been annexed to the plaint with the official translationAs this letter started all the trouble between the parties to this litigation, it will have to be set out in extenso hereinafterTo receive him back from his foreign journey the whole family including the defendant was there in BombayHe handed it to a photographer to have photo copies made of the same100 for her expensesBut she refused the offerwhen the plaintiff came back home from his office, he discovered that she had taken away everything with her and had left nothing behind,The parties violently differ on the intent and effect of this letter which will have to be set out in extenso at the appropriate placeThe telegram is worded as follows:- Must not send PrabhaWishing happy new year4Hence the original, if any, is not on the recordC and is to the following effect:- Bombay 13-11-47 To 5Rajmanya Rajeshri Seth Popatlal & othersFurther, this is to inform you that I have received information from my Mami (mother) that Prabha is going to come to Bombay in 3 or 4 daysI am surprised to hear this news; Ever since she has gone to Jalgaon, there has been not a single letter from her to this dayNot only that, but, although you know everything, neither you nor any one on your behalf has come to see me in this connection6After her behaviour while going to Jalgaon for: the marriage, (and after), her letter to Mahendra and her wordsHe is better than you-Has feeling for me and I love him and all this, I was afraid that she would not set up a house with meHence when my mother gave me the news of her return, I was surprised7I have not the slightest objection to the return of Prabha, but if she gives such shameless replies to me and shows such improper behaviour, I shall not be able to tolerate the sameIf she now really realises her mistake and if she is really repenting and wants sincerely to come, please make her write a reply to this letterKirit is youngFor his sake also, it is necessary to persuade PrabhaFurther, I have to state that I have so far kept peacePlease understand this to her my final effortIf even now Prabha does not give up her obstinacy, I am not responsible and (then) do not blame me8Well, that is all for the presentKirit must be bale and heartyMy new years greetings to you allPlease do assign to me such work-as I can manageWritten by Bipinchandra 9D This letter makes referenceThe defendant has given quite a different version of this interview10947E, or that she had confessed any such intimacy to the plaintiffShe added that her paternal uncle Bhogilal (since deceased) and his son Babubhai saw the plaintiff in Bombay at the instance of the defendant and her father and that the plaintiff turned down their request for taking her backOn those allegations she resisted the plaintiffs claim for a decree for a dissolution of the marriage11On those pleadings a single issue was joined between the parties, namely,- Whether the defendant deserted the plaintiff for a continuous period of over four years prior to the filing of the suit1213E reads like a love letter written by a girl to her paramourThe reference to both of them having been anxious about something and there being now no need to be anxious any more can only be to a possible fear that she might miss her monthly periods and her having got her monthly period thereafter, because, if it were not so and the reference was to anything innocent, there was nothing that she should have repented later on in her mind as she says she did, nor should there have been occasion for saying after all love is such an affairWith reference to that letter he further held that it was capable of the interpretation that she had misbehaved with Mahendra and that she was conscious of her guiltHe made no reference to the prayer in the plaint that the custody of the child should be given to the father, perhaps because that prayer was not pressed14Division Bench consisting of Chagla CJ and Bhagwati J The Appellate Bench, allowed the appeal, set aside the decision of the trial Judge and dismissed the suit with costsThe leave asked for was refused by another Division Bench consisting of the Chief Justice and Dixit J Thereafter the plaintiff moved this Court and obtained special leave to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Bench of the High Court15In this appeal the learned Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the appellant and the learned Solicitor-General appearing on behalf of the respondent have placed all relevant considerations of fact and law before us, and we are beholden to them for the great assistance they rendered to us in deciding this difficult caseThe difficulty is enhanced by the fact that the two courts below have taken diametrically opposite views of the facts of the case which depend mostly upon oral testimony of the plaintiff-husband and the defendant-wife and not corroborated in many respects on either sideIt is a case of the husbands testimony alone on his side and the wifes testimony aided by that of her father and her cousin16Before we deal with the points in controversy, it is convenient here to make certain general of observations on the history of the law on the subject and the well established general principles on which such cases are determinedThe suit giving rise to this appeal is based on s3(1)(d) of the Bombay Hindu Divorce Act, XXII of 1947, (which hereinafter will be referred to as the Act) which came into force on May 12, 1947, the date the Governors assent was published in the Bombay Government GazetteThis Act, so far as the Bombay Province, as it then was, was concerned, was the first step in revolutionizing the law of matrimonial relationship, and, as the Preamble shows, was meant to provide for a right of divorce among all communities of Hindus in certain circumstancesBefore the enactment, dissolution of a Hindu marriage particularly amongst what were called the regenerate classes was unknown to general Hindu law and was wholly inconsistent with the basic conception of a Hindu marriage as a sacrament, that is to say, a holy alliance for the performance of religious dutiesAccording to the Shastras, marriage amongst the Hindus was the last of the ten sacraments enjoined by the Hindu religion for purificationHence according to strict Hindu law as given by the Samhitas and as developed by the commentators, a Hindu marriage could not be dissolved on any-ground whatsoever, even on account of degradation in the hierarchy of castes or apostacyBut custom, particularly amongst the tribal and what used to be called the lower castes recognised divorce on rather easy termsSuch customs of divorce on easy terms have been in some instances held by the courts to be against public policy3 sets out the grounds of divorceIt is noticeable that the Act does not recognise adultery simpliciter as one of the grounds of divorce, though cl(f) renders the fact that a husband has any other woman as a concubine and that a wife is a concubine of any other man or leads the life of a prostitute a ground of divorceIn the present case we are immediately concerned with the provisions of s3(1)(d), which are in these terms:- 17Desertion has been defined in s18It will be seen that the definition is tautological and not very helpful and leads us to the Common Law of England where in spite of repeated legislation on the subject of matrimonial law, no attempt has been made to define desertionHence a large body of case law has developed round the legal significance of desertionMarriage under the Act means a marriage between Hindus whether contracted before or after the coming into operation of this Act19In England until 1858 the only remedy for desertion was a suit for restitution of conjugal rightsThe law has now been consolidated in the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1950 (14 GeoVI, c25 )It would thus appear that desertion as affording a cause of action for a suit for dissolution of marriage is a recent growth even in England20What is desertion?Rayden on Divorce which is a standard Work on the subject at p128 (6th Edn21The legal position has been admirably summarised in paras453 and 454 at pp241 to 243 of Halsburys Laws of England (3rd Edn) VolIt is a total repudiation of the obligations of marriageIn view of the large variety of circumstances and of modes of life involved, the Court has discouraged attempts at defining desertion, there being no general principle applicable to all casesDesertion is not the withdrawal from a place but from a state of things, for what the law seeks to enforce is the recognition and discharge of the common obligations of the married state; the state of things may usually be termed, for short, the homeThe offence of desertion is a course of conduct which exists independently of its duration, but as a ground for divorce it must exist for a period of at least three years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition or, where the offence appears as a cross-charge, of the answerThus the quality of permanence is one of the essential elements which differentiates desertion from wilful separationIf a spouse abandon the other spouse in a state of temporary passion, for example, anger or disgust, without intending permanently to cease cohabitation, it will not amount to desertion, namely, (1) the factum of separation, and (2) the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end (animus deserendi )Here a difference between the English law and the law as enacted by the Bombay Legislature may be pointed outWhether the omission of the last clause has any practical result need not detain us, as it does not call for decision in the present caseIf, in fact, there has been a separation, the essential question always is whether that act could be attributable to an animus deserendiBut it is not necessary that they should commence at the same timeHence, though corroboration is not required as an absolute rule of law, the courts insist upon corroborative evidence, unless its absence is accounted for to the satisfaction of the courtIn this connection the following observations of Lord Goddard, CJ in the case of Lawson vLawson([1955] 1 All ER 341, 342) may be referred to:- These cases are not cases in which corroboration is required as a matter of lawIt is required as a matter of precautionThe plaintiff expressed his wish to the defendant that they should sleep in the same room as they used to before his departure for England, to which the wife replied that as the bed had already been made, it would look indecent if they were removedAs the learned trial Judge has preferred the plaintiffs testimony to that of the defendant on all matters on which there was simply oath against oath, we would not go behind that findingThere was no reason why the husband should have thought of sleeping apart from the wife because there was no suggestion in the record that the husband was aware till then of the alleged relationship between the defendant and MahendraI have read the same and have noted the contentsI am writing, this letter with fear in my mind, because if this reaches anybodys hands, that cannot be said to be decent22What the mind feels has got to be constrained in the mind onlyOn the pretext of lulling (my) son to sleep, I have been sitting here in this attic, writing this letter to youAll others are chitchatting belowI am thinking now and then that I shall write this and shall write thatJust now my brain cannot go in any wayI do not feel like writing on the main pointThe matters on which we were to remain anxious and you particularly were anxious, well we need not now beI very much repented later on in my mindBut after all love is such an affair(Love begets love)While yet busy doing services to my mother-in-law, the clock strikes twelveAt this time, I think of you and you only, and your portrait shoots up before my eyesI am reminded of you every timeYou write of coming, but just now there is nothing like a necessity, why unnecessarily waste money?And again nobody gets salvation at my bands and really nobody willYou know the natures of allMany a time I get tired and keep on being uneasy in my mind, and in the end I weep and pray God and say, 0 Lord, kindly take me away soon: I am not obsessed by any kind of anxiety and so relieve me from this mundane existence23At that time it was no more a contested document, the defendants counsel having admitted it during the cross-examination of the plaintiffShe stated that she had feelings for Mahendra as a brother and not as a lover When the mysterious parts of the letter beginning with the words The matters on which and ending with the words such an affair were put to her, she could not give any explanation as to what she meantShe denied the suggestion made on behalf of the plaintiff in these words:- It is not true that the reference here is to our having had sexual intercourse and being afraid that I might remain pregnant24The sentence I very much repented later on in my mind was also put to her specifically and her answer was I do not know what I repented forI wrote some thing foolishly25Besides the fact that my brain was not working properly I bad no explanation to give as to how I wrote such a letterBeing further pressed to explain the sentence We need not be anxious now, her answer was  I did not intend to convey that I had got my monthly period about which we were anxiousIt must have remained to be signed by mistakeIt is not true that I did not sign this letter because I was afraid, that if it got into the hands of any one, it might compromise me and MahendraI had only said Namaste26Even when given the opportunity to explain, if she could, those portions of the letter, she was not able to put any innocent meaning to her words except saying in a bland way that it was a letter from a sister to a brotherThe letter shows a correspondence between her and Mahendra which was clearly unworthy of a faithful wife and her pose of innocence by characterising it as between a sister and a brother is manifestly disingenuousHer explanation, if any, is wholly unacceptableThe very fact that a married girl was writing amorous letters to a man other than her husband was reprehensible and easily capable of furnishing good grounds to the husband for suspecting the wifes fidelitySo far there can be no difficulty in assuming that the husband was fully justified in losing temper with his wife and in insisting upon her repentance and assurance of good conduct in futureWe cannot but sympathise with the husband in taking a very serious view of the lapse on the wifes partThey observe in their judgment (speaking through the Chief Justice) that there was no justification for the counsel for the plaintiff to put to the defendant those questions in cross-examination suggesting that she had intercourse with Mahendra as a result of which they were apprehending future trouble in the shape of pregnancy and illegitimate child birth27She would naturally wish to be out of the sight of her husband at least for some time, to gain time for trying, if she was so minded, to reestablish herself in her husbands estimation and affection, if not loveThere was going to be performed the marriage of the defendants cousin at her fathers place of business in Jalgaon, though it was about five to six weeks from thenThe plaintiff would make it out in his evidence that she left rather in a recalcitrant mood in the afternoon during his absence in office with all her belongings and that she had refused his offer of being sent in his car to station and Rs100 for expensesShe would-naturally try to flee away from the husband for the time being at least because she had not the moral courage to face hime, being in desertion?The following observations of Pollock, M R in Thomas vThomas([1924] P 194) may usefully be quoted in this connection:- Desertion is not a single act complete in itself and revocable by a single act of repentancethe Act of departure from the other spouse draws its significance from the purpose with which it is done, as revealed by conduct or other expressions of intention: see Charter vCharter ( 84 L T 272 )A mere temporary parting is equivocal, unless and until its purpose and object is made plainWilkinson( 58 J P 415) that desertion is not a specific act, but a course of conductAs Corell Barnes J said in Sickert vSickert([1899] P 278, 282 : The party who intends bringing the cohabitation to an end, and whose conduct in reality causes its termination, commits the Act of desertion28(See Lang vLang ([1955] AC 402417))It should be noted that the wife did not cross-petition for divorce or for any other reliefIt is enough to point out that we are not prepared to rely upon the uncorroborated testimony of the defendant Chat she had been compelled to leave her marital home by the threats of the plaintiff29But they are also consistent not with the defendants case as actually Pleaded in her written statement, but with the fact; and circumstances disclosed in the evidence, namely, that the defendant having been discovered in her clandestine amorous correspondence with her supposed paramour Mahendra, she could not face her husband or her husbands people living in the same flat in Bombay and therefore shamefacedly withdrew herself and went to her parents place of business in Jalgaon on the pretext of the marriage of her cousin which was yet far offThat she was not expected at Jalgaon on that day in connection with the marriage is proved by her own admission in the witness box that when I went to Jalgaon everyone was surprisedIn this connection the following observations of Lord Macmillan in his speech in the House of Lords in the case of Pratt vPratt([1939] A C 417, 420) are apposite:- In my opinion what is required of a petitioner for divorce on the ground of desertion is proof that throughout the whole course of the three years the respondent has without cause been in desertionShe, on the other hand, pleaded constructive desertion by the husbandThat case, as already observed, she has failed to substantiate by reliable evidence30The letter is in these terms:- Madam, Under instructions from our client Bipin Chandra J Shah we have to address you as under:- That you were married to our client in or about April 1942 at PatanSince the marriage you and our client lived together mostly in Bombay and son by name Kirit was born on or about the 10th day of September 1944Our clientAfter our clients return, our client learnt that during our clients absence from India you developed intimacy with one Mahendra and you failed to give any satisfactory reply when questioned about the same and left for your parents under the pretext of attending to the marriage ceremony of your cousinYou have also taken the minor with you and since then you are residing with your father to evade any satisfactory explanationOur client states that under the events that have happened, our client has become entitled to obtain a divorce and our client does not desire to keep you any longer under his care and protectionOur client has made this inquiry about the minor to avoid any unpleasantness when our clients agent comes to receive the minor31The letter is remarkable in some respects,apart from antedating the birth of the son Kirit by a yearOn the other hand, it alleges that You are residing with your father to avoid any satisfactory explanationThe most important part of the letter is to the effect that the plaintiff had become entitled to obtain a divorce and that he does not desire to keep you any longer under his care and protectionThe statement of the law in para 457 at p244 of Halsburys Laws of England (3rd EdnVol 12) may be usefully quoted: The burden is on the petitioner to show that desertion without cause subsisted, throughout the statutory periodThat presumption may, however, be rebutted32A) is an emphatic noRealising his difficulty when cross-examined as to the contents of that letter, he wished the court to believe that at the time the letter was written in his presence he was in a confused state of mind and did not remember exactly whether he noticed the sentence -that he did not desire to keep his wife any longerI am still in the confused state of mind that despite my repeated attempts my wife puts me offThat, as found by us, be was justified in this attitude by the reprehensible conduct of his wife during his absence is beside the pointE and that the wife left her husbands place in shame not having the courage to face him after that discoveryBut that will not render her in the eye of the law a deserter, as observed by Pollock, M R in Bowron vBowron([1925] P 187, 192) partly quoting from Lord Gorell as follows:- In most cases of desertion the guilty party actually leaves the other, but it is not always or necessarily the guilty party who leaves the matrimonial homeIn my opinion, the party who intends bringing the cohabitation to an end, and whose conduct in reality causes its termination, commits the Act of desertion: See also Graves vGraves(3 Sw& Tr350); Pulford vPulford([1923] P 18); Jackson vJackson([1924] P 19); where Sir Henry Duke P explains the same doctrineYou must look at the conduct of the spouses and ascertain their real intention33So far we do not34This is in consonance with the latest pronouncement of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Lang vThe contest in such a case will be almost entirely as to the animus3536Prabhavati3738394041424344", "Summary1000": "Bipin Chander Jaisinghbhai Shah v Prabhawati Supreme Court of India  19 October 1956 Civil Appeal No247 of 1953 The Judgment was delivered by : Bhuvaneshwar Prasad Sinha, J 1This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment and decree of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated August 22,1952, reversing those of a single Judge of that Court on the Original Side, dated March 7,1952, by which he had granted a decree for dissolution of marriage between the appellant and the respondent2The facts and circumstances of this case may be stated as follows: The appellant, who was the plaintiff, and the respondent were married at Patan on April 20, 1942, according to Hindu rites of the Jain CommunityThe families of both the parties belong to Patan, which is a town in Gujarat, about a nights rail journey from BombayThey lived in Bombay in a two-room flat which was in occupation of the appellants family consisting of his parents and his two sisters, who occupied the larger room called the hall, and the plaintiff and the defendant who occupied the smaller room called the kitchenThe appellants mother who is a patient of asthma lived mostly at PatanThere is an issue of the marriage, a son named Kirit, born on September 10, 1945The defendants parents lived mostly at Jaigaon in the East Khandesh district in BombayThe parties appear to have lived happily in Bombay until a third party named Mahendra, a friend of the family came upon the scene and began to live with the family in their Bombay flat some time in 1946, after his discharge from the armyOn January 8, 1947, the appellant left for England on businessE as officially translated in English, the original being in Gujerati except a few words written in faulty English3This letter had been annexed to the plaint with the official translationAs this letter started all the trouble between the parties to this litigation, it will have to be set out in extenso hereinafterTo receive him back from his foreign journey the whole family including the defendant was there in BombayHe handed it to a photographer to have photo copies made of the same100 for her expensesBut she refused the offerwhen the plaintiff came back home from his office, he discovered that she had taken away everything with her and had left nothing behind,The parties violently differ on the intent and effect of this letter which will have to be set out in extenso at the appropriate placeThe telegram is worded as follows:- Must not send PrabhaWishing happy new year4Hence the original, if any, is not on the recordC and is to the following effect:- Bombay 13-11-47 To 5Rajmanya Rajeshri Seth Popatlal & othersFurther, this is to inform you that I have received information from my Mami (mother) that Prabha is going to come to Bombay in 3 or 4 daysI am surprised to hear this news Ever since she has gone to Jalgaon, there has been not a single letter from her to this dayNot only that, but, although you know everything, neither you nor any one on your behalf has come to see me in this connection6After her behaviour while going to Jalgaon for: the marriage, (and after), her letter to Mahendra and her wordsHe is better than you-Has feeling for me and I love him and all this, I was afraid that she would not set up a house with meHence when my mother gave me the news of her return, I was surprised7I have not the slightest objection to the return of Prabha, but if she gives such shameless replies to me and shows such improper behaviour, I shall not be able to tolerate the sameIf she now really realises her mistake and if she is really repenting and wants sincerely to come, please make her write a reply to this letterKirit is youngFor his sake also, it is necessary to persuade PrabhaFurther, I have to state that I have so far kept peacePlease understand this to her my final effortIf even now Prabha does not give up her obstinacy, I am not responsible and (then) do not blame me8Well, that is all for the presentKirit must be bale and heartyMy new years greetings to you allPlease do assign to me such work-as I can manageWritten by Bipinchandra 9D This letter makes referenceThe defendant has given quite a different version of this interview10947E, or that she had confessed any such intimacy to the plaintiffShe added that her paternal uncle Bhogilal (since deceased) and his son Babubhai saw the plaintiff in Bombay at the instance of the defendant and her father and that the plaintiff turned down their request for taking her backOn those allegations she resisted the plaintiffs claim for a decree for a dissolution of the marriage11On those pleadings a single issue was joined between the parties, namely,- Whether the defendant deserted the plaintiff for a continuous period of over four years prior to the filing of the suit1213E reads like a love letter written by a girl to her paramourThe reference to both of them having been anxious about something and there being now no need to be anxious any more can only be to a possible fear that she might miss her monthly periods and her having got her monthly period thereafter, because, if it were not so and the reference was to anything innocent, there was nothing that she should have repented later on in her mind as she says she did, nor should there have been occasion for saying after all love is such an affairWith reference to that letter he further held that it was capable of the interpretation that she had misbehaved with Mahendra and that she was conscious of her guiltHe made no reference to the prayer in the plaint that the custody of the child should be given to the father, perhaps because that prayer was not pressed14Division Bench consisting of Chagla CJ and Bhagwati J The Appellate Bench, allowed the appeal, set aside the decision of the trial Judge and dismissed the suit with costsThe leave asked for was refused by another Division Bench consisting of the Chief Justice and Dixit J Thereafter the plaintiff moved this Court and obtained special leave to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Bench of the High Court15In this appeal the learned Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the appellant and the learned Solicitor-General appearing on behalf of the respondent have placed all relevant considerations of fact and law before us, and we are beholden to them for the great assistance they rendered to us in deciding this difficult caseThe difficulty is enhanced by the fact that the two courts below have taken diametrically opposite views of the facts of the case which depend mostly upon oral testimony of the plaintiff-husband and the defendant-wife and not corroborated in many respects on either sideIt is a case of the husbands testimony alone on his side and the wifes testimony aided by that of her father and her cousin16Before we deal with the points in controversy, it is convenient here to make certain general of observations on the history of the law on the subject and the well established general principles on which such cases are determinedThe suit giving rise to this appeal is based on s3(1)(d) of the Bombay Hindu Divorce Act, XXII of 1947, (which hereinafter will be referred to as the Act) which came into force on May 12, 1947, the date the Governors assent was published in the Bombay Government GazetteThis Act, so far as the Bombay Province, as it then was, was concerned, was the first step in revolutionizing the law of matrimonial relationship, and, as the Preamble shows, was meant to provide for a right of divorce among all communities of Hindus in certain circumstancesBefore the enactment, dissolution of a Hindu marriage particularly amongst what were called the regenerate classes was unknown to general Hindu law and was wholly inconsistent with the basic conception of a Hindu marriage as a sacrament, that is to say, a holy alliance for the performance of religious dutiesAccording to the Shastras, marriage amongst the Hindus was the last of the ten sacraments enjoined by the Hindu religion for purificationHence according to strict Hindu law as given by the Samhitas and as developed by the commentators, a Hindu marriage could not be dissolved on any-ground whatsoever, even on account of degradation in the hierarchy of castes or apostacyBut custom, particularly amongst the tribal and what used to be called the lower castes recognised divorce on rather easy termsSuch customs of divorce on easy terms have been in some instances held by the courts to be against public policy3 sets out the grounds of divorceIt is noticeable that the Act does not recognise adultery simpliciter as one of the grounds of divorce, though cl(f) renders the fact that a husband has any other woman as a concubine and that a wife is a concubine of any other man or leads the life of a prostitute a ground of divorceIn the present case we are immediately concerned with the provisions of s3(1)(d), which are in these terms:- 17Desertion has been defined in s18It will be seen that the definition is tautological and not very helpful and leads us to the Common Law of England where in spite of repeated legislation on the subject of matrimonial law, no attempt has been made to define desertionHence a large body of case law has developed round the legal significance of desertionMarriage under the Act means a marriage between Hindus whether contracted before or after the coming into operation of this Act19In England until 1858 the only remedy for desertion was a suit for restitution of conjugal rightsThe law has now been consolidated in the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1950 (14 GeoVI, c25 )It would thus appear that desertion as affording a cause of action for a suit for dissolution of marriage is a recent growth even in England20What is desertion?Rayden on Divorce which is a standard Work on the subject at p128 (6th Edn21The legal position has been admirably summarised in paras453 and 454 at pp241 to 243 of Halsburys Laws of England (3rd Edn) VolIt is a total repudiation of the obligations of marriageIn view of the large variety of circumstances and of modes of life involved, the Court has discouraged attempts at defining desertion, there being no general principle applicable to all casesDesertion is not the withdrawal from a place but from a state of things, for what the law seeks to enforce is the recognition and discharge of the common obligations of the married state the state of things may usually be termed, for short, the homeThe offence of desertion is a course of conduct which exists independently of its duration, but as a ground for divorce it must exist for a period of at least three years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition or, where the offence appears as a cross-charge, of the answerThus the quality of permanence is one of the essential elements which differentiates desertion from wilful separationIf a spouse abandon the other spouse in a state of temporary passion, for example, anger or disgust, without intending permanently to cease cohabitation, it will not amount to desertion, namely, (1) the factum of separation, and (2) the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end (animus deserendi )Here a difference between the English law and the law as enacted by the Bombay Legislature may be pointed outWhether the omission of the last clause has any practical result need not detain us, as it does not call for decision in the present caseIf, in fact, there has been a separation, the essential question always is whether that act could be attributable to an animus deserendiBut it is not necessary that they should commence at the same timeHence, though corroboration is not required as an absolute rule of law, the courts insist upon corroborative evidence, unless its absence is accounted for to the satisfaction of the courtIn this connection the following observations of Lord Goddard, CJ in the case of Lawson vLawson([1955] 1 All ER 341, 342) may be referred to:- These cases are not cases in which corroboration is required as a matter of lawIt is required as a matter of precautionThe plaintiff expressed his wish to the defendant that they should sleep in the same room as they used to before his departure for England, to which the wife replied that as the bed had already been made, it would look indecent if they were removedAs the learned trial Judge has preferred the plaintiffs testimony to that of the defendant on all matters on which there was simply oath against oath, we would not go behind that findingThere was no reason why the husband should have thought of sleeping apart from the wife because there was no suggestion in the record that the husband was aware till then of the alleged relationship between the defendant and MahendraI have read the same and have noted the contentsI am writing, this letter with fear in my mind, because if this reaches anybodys hands, that cannot be said to be decent22What the mind feels has got to be constrained in the mind onlyOn the pretext of lulling (my) son to sleep, I have been sitting here in this attic, writing this letter to youAll others are chitchatting belowI am thinking now and then that I shall write this and shall write thatJust now my brain cannot go in any wayI do not feel like writing on the main pointThe matters on which we were to remain anxious and you particularly were anxious, well we need not now beI very much repented later on in my mindBut after all love is such an affair(Love begets love)While yet busy doing services to my mother-in-law, the clock strikes twelveAt this time, I think of you and you only, and your portrait shoots up before my eyesI am reminded of you every timeYou write of coming, but just now there is nothing like a necessity, why unnecessarily waste money?And again nobody gets salvation at my bands and really nobody willYou know the natures of allMany a time I get tired and keep on being uneasy in my mind, and in the end I weep and pray God and say, 0 Lord, kindly take me away soon: I am not obsessed by any kind of anxiety and so relieve me from this mundane existence23At that time it was no more a contested document, the defendants counsel having admitted it during the cross-examination of the plaintiffShe stated that she had feelings for Mahendra as a brother and not as a lover When the mysterious parts of the letter beginning with the words The matters on which and ending with the words such an affair were put to her, she could not give any explanation as to what she meantShe denied the suggestion made on behalf of the plaintiff in

decree dated  December The Judgment was delivered by: A K Sarkar, J 1The Princely States that existed in British India, merged themselves in the Union of India not very long after India became independentBefore the merger some of these States passed through certain stages which may be called transitionalUp to April 22, 1948, Indore as one of the Princely States of India enjoyed internal sovereign rights and had its own laws and courts2It, was a suit for the specific performance of an agreement whereby it is said, Govindram Sakstria, whose heirs and legal representatives the respondents are, agreed to sell to the appellant a share in a businessThe said Govindram Saksaria having died prior to the suit it was brought against the respondentsArt3 of the Covenant provided for the constitution of a Council of Rulers one of the members of which was to be its President, such President being called the RajpramukhUnder art 6 of the Covenant, the Ruler of each covenanting tate was required to make over the administration of his State to the Raj Pramukh by a date not later than July 1, 19483This article also provided that upon the administration of a State being made over to

delivered by : Jagannadhadas, J 1The prosecution was launched on the first information of one Ram Naresh Pandey as against 28 persons about the commission of the murder of one Nand Kumar Chaubey, a peon of a colliery in Bagdigi, committed in the course of a serious riot on February 20, 1954This was said to have resulted from differences between two rival labour-unions in connection with a strike302, on the ground of their actual participation in the commission of the murder302 /109 of the Indian Penal Code, the part ascribed to him in the first information report being that he abetted the murder by reason of certain speeches and exhortations at meetings or group-talks the day previous to the murderIt was elicited in the course of the arguments before the learned Magistratethat the position of the Public Prosecutor was, that the evidence regarding the complicity of this accused was meagre and that there WAS only, a single item of evidence of a dubious nature against himwhich was not likely to establish a prima facie caseHe accordingly discharged the accusedThat-order was upheld by the learned Sessions Judge on, revision petition against it filed jointly by the first informant in the case and by the, widow of the murdered personThese private parties pursued the matter further and applied to the High Court in revisionAccordingly, he set it asideThe aggrieved party, Mahesh Desai, also has come up by special leave and both these appeals are disposed of by this judgment2The,question of law involved may be gathered from the following extracts from the learned Chief Justices judgmentI do4The -section gives no indication as to the, grounds on which the Public Prosecutor may make the application, or the considerationson, which the Court is -to grant its consentThere can be no doubt, how ever, that the resultant order, on the granting of the consent, being an order of I discharge or acuittal, would attract the applicability of correction by; the High Court under es435, 436 and 439 or 417 of the Code of Criminal ProcedureOtherwise the apparently wide language of s494 would become considerably narrowed down in its applicationAs ;the Privy Council has pointed out in Bawa Faqir Singh vIn this context it is right to remember that the Public Prosecutor  (though an executive officer as stated by the Privy Council in Bawa Faqir Singh vThe King Emperor ( (1938) L R 65 I A 388, 395)) is, in a larger sense, also an officer of the Court and that he is bound to assist the Court with his fairly-considered view and the Court is entitled to have the benefit of the fair exercise of his functionIt has also to be appreciated that in this country, the scheme of the administration of criminal justice is that the primary responsibility of prosecuting serious offences  (which are classified as cognizable offences) is on the executive authoritiesOnce information of the commission of any such offence reaches the constituted authorities, the investigation, including collection of the requisite evidence, and the prosecution for the offence with reference to such evidence, are the functions of the executiveFor instance, in the course of investigation, a person arrested must be brought before him within 24 hours  (sContinuance of the arrested person in detention for purposes of investigation from time to time has to be authorised by him  (s167)A search can be conducted on the issue of warrant by him  (s96)5164)155 (2) and 202)In all these matters he exercises discretionary functions in respect of which the initiative is that of

King vMoule Bux (AIR 1949 Pat 233  (FB)) 1948 Indlaw PAT 664 andParmanand (AIR 1949 Pat222] If so, it is clear that, what the Court has to determine, for the exercise of its discretion in granting or withholding consent, is not a triable issue on judicial evidence7evidence or no adequate or reliable evidence494 an exception or & proviso limited to such a caseIn our opinion, this would not be a permissible construction of the sectionWe are, therefore, unable, with great respect, to subscribe to the view taken by the learned Chief Justice whose judgment is under appeal, that where the application is on the ground of inadequacy of evidence requiring judicial consideration, it would be manifestly improper for the Court to -consent to withdrawal before recording the evidence and taking it into consideration8The point being purely one of law, we have allowed it to be arguedThe use of the word tried in this phraseHe draws our attention to a passage in Archbolds Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice  (32nd Ed),pp108, 109, s12, that a nolle prosequi to stay proceedings upon an indictment -or information pending in any Court may be entered, by leave of the Attorney General, at the instance of either the prosecutor or the defendant at any time after the bill of indictment is signed, and before judgmentHe urges that it is this principle that has been recognised in the first portion of sIt appears to us that the analogy of the English practice would be misleading as an aid to the construction of s494The provision corresponding to the power of the Attorney-General to enter nolle prosequi is sWe can find no conceivable reason for any such discrimination having been intended and prescribed by the CodeWe are unable to construe s9The whole argument of the learned counsel is based upon the use of the word ,tried and he ehaphasises the well-known distinction between inquiry and trial in the scheme of the Code10There is hardly anything in this definition which throws light-on the question whether the word trial, is used in the relevant section in a limited sense as excluding an inquiryTrial according to Strouds Judicial Dictionary means the conclusion, by a competent tribunal, of questions in issue in legal proceedings, whether civil or criminal (1) and according to Whartons Law Lexicon means the hearing of a cause, civil or criminal, before a judge who has jurisdiction over it, according to the laws of the land (2)11The words tried and trial appear to have no fixed or universal meaning12494 as indicating that the phrase in other oases can refer only to proceedings which end in a regular judgment and not in any interim order like commitmentIt is a word of general import and means only judicial determination or decision of a Court13In any view, even if judgment, in this context is to be understood in a limited sense, it does not follow that an application during preliminary inquiry-which is necessarily prior to judgment in the trial-is excluded1415of any person; and, upon such withdrawal, (a) if it is made before a charge has been framed, the accused shall be discharged; (b) if it is made after a charge has been framed, or when under this Code, no charge is required, he shall be acquitted16It may be noticed that there has been a complete redrafting of the section which brings about two alterationsthis section seems to have remained as such in the 1898 Code  (Act V of 1898)494 as it stood in the 1882 Code  (in addition to omitting the phrase appointed by the Governor General in Council or Local Government)It will be thus seen there are altogether three substantial changes in between 1872 and 1923 in the corresponding sThe first two changes made in 1882 were obviously intended to indicate that the result by way of discharge or acquittal should depend not on the distinction between inquiry and trial but, on the fact of a charge having been framed or not having been framedThe third change in 1923 was to make it clear that the withdrawal need not be in respect of the entire case against a particular individual but in respect of one or more only of the charges for which he is being prosecutedThese three changes, therefore, were introduced for spcific purposes which are obviousThere is absolutely no reason to think that these successive, changes were intended to exclude such a preliminary inquiry from the scope of s494 as it has finally emergedIt may also be mentioned that the words  inquiry and trial were both defined in the Code of 1872 but that the definition of the word trial was omitted, in the 1882 Code and that latter on in the 1898 Code the definition of the word inquiry was slightly altered by adding the ,phrase Other than a trial leaving the, word trial undefinedSubstantially the same view has been taken in Giribala Dasee vMadar Gazi  ([1932] ILR 6o Cal233) 1932 Indlaw CAL 285 and Viswanadham vMadan Singh (ILR [1949] Mad64) 1948 Indlaw MAD 309 and we are in agreement with the reasoning therein as regards this question17As regards the merits of the appeals, the matter lies in a short compass18What is alleged against the appellant, Mahesh Desai, in the first information report can be gathered from the following: These persons, viz, Mahesh Desai and others,regularly held meetings and advocated for closing Bagdigi cable plant and coke plant and assaulting the dalalsYesterday, Friday morning when some labourers were going to resume their work in 8 Nopit, at Lodna the striking labourers created disturbance there and the labourers of that place who were going to resume work could not do soMahesh Desai the leader of the Koyala Mazdoor Panchayat came to Bagdigi and told the labourers of this place to stop all work, to hold on to their posts and to see that no one workedLast night at about 11-30 pwhen I was in my quarter at Lodna, Jadubans Tiwary, the overman of Bagdigi Colliery, said that Sheoji Singh and Ramdhar Singh had told him that in the evening at about 6-30 pMahesh Desai came to Bagdigi Mahabir Asthan Chala, collected 120 to 125 labourers and held a meeting and Mahesh Desai said that he had come to know that the company and its dalals would take some labourers to pit NoIn this morning Phagu Dusadh, Jalo Dusadh, Chamari Dusadh and others were  (sic) took partYou remain, prepared in every respect19The meeting

in the trial-is excluded1415of any person and, upon such withdrawal, (a) if it is made before a charge has been framed, the accused shall be discharged (b) if it is made after a charge has been framed, or when under this Code, no charge is required, he shall be acquitted16It may be noticed that there has been a complete redrafting of the section which brings about two alterationsthis section seems to have remained as such in the 1898 Code  (Act V of 1898)494 as it stood in the 1882 Code  (in addition to omitting the phrase appointed by the Governor General in Council or Local Government)It will be thus seen there are altogether three substantial changes in between 1872 and 1923 in the corresponding sThe first two changes made in 1882 were obviously intended to indicate that the result by way of discharge or acquittal should depend not on the distinction between inquiry and trial but, on the fact of a charge having been framed or not having been framedThe third change in 1923 was to make it clear that the withdrawal need not be in respect of the entire case against a particular individual but in respect of one or more only of the charges for which he is being prosecutedThese three changes, therefore, were introduced for spcific purposes which are obviousThere is absolutely no reason to think that these successive, changes were intended to exclude such a preliminary inquiry from the scope of s494 as it has finally emergedIt may also be mentioned that the words  inquiry and trial were both defined in the Code of 1872 but that the definition of the word trial was omitted, in the 1882 Code and that latter on in the 1898 Code the definition of the word inquiry was slightly altered by adding the ,phrase Other than a trial leaving the, word trial undefinedSubstantially the same view has been taken in Giribala Dasee vMadar Gazi  ([1932] ILR 6o Cal233) 1932 Indlaw CAL 285 and Viswanadham vMadan Singh (ILR [1949] Mad64) 1948 Indlaw MAD 309 and we are in agreement with the reasoning therein as regards this question17As regards the merits of the appeals, the matter lies in a short compass18What is alleged against the appellant, Mahesh Desai, in the first information report can be gathered from the following: These persons, viz, Mahesh Desai and others,regularly held meetings and advocated for closing Bagdigi cable plant and coke plant and assaulting the dalalsYesterday, Friday morning when some labourers were going to resume their work in 8 Nopit, at Lodna the striking labourers created disturbance there and the labourers of
