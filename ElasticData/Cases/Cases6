As per annexure-C so far as open category candidates are concerned, they are shown in the order of merits upto sl. no. 16. There are also 2 Scheduled Castes and 2 Scheduled Tribes candidates in all making 20. The extend of selected Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates on reservation quota works out to be 1/5 of the total 20 selected candidates. If this list has to operate, as we have held, only till vacancies are filled up, then on the ratio of 115 of the total vacancies to be filled up, the posts to be reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes out of total 1 1 posts could be one each for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates, as 1/5 of 11 would be 2.5 which would yield either 2 reserved candidates or maximum 3 candidates but as maximum 3 candidates may tilt the inter se balance between the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, if either of these two categories is given 2 posts out of 3, interest of justice would be served if we direct the respondents to reserve 2 posts in all out of II for being filled up by 1 Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidate each, in the order of inter se merits of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe selected candidates as mentioned in the list at annexure-C. The remaining 9 posts will be available to general category candidates as listed in order of merits in the list at annexure-C. The moment these 11 posts are filled up within 1 year of the publication of list at annexureC this list will get exhausted or if for any reason these II vacancies could not be filled up by the time one year from the date of publication of the list is over, even then the list would get exhausted and fresh recruitment will have to be made in the light of fresh requisition from the State. For computing one year's currency of impugned select list as per rule 41, the period during which appointments were stayed during pendency of these proceedings would naturally got excluded. The contention no.8 therefore will stand accepted to the aforesaid extent. In the result this writ petition fails subject only to the directions issued by us to the State Government while accepting contention no. 8 aforesaid. In the facts and circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.\n"}

We are also unable to accept the alternative contention that directions be issued to rehabilitation authorities to transfer the property jointly with other persons who may be found entitled thereto at the market value of the year 1969 or at best of 1973 in view of the fact that the appellant has been in possession of the property for nearly half a century. In view of the conduct of the appellant in the manner in which he tried to get the property transferred in his favour, we do not find any equities in his favour so as to issue the directions sought for. We find no infirmity in the judgment of the High Court. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.\n"}

{"date": "12 November 1980", "filename": "1980_S_103", "title": "Ved Prakash v State Of Haryana", "cit-id": "1980 Indlaw SC 233", "case-cat": "", "subject": "Criminal| Defence & Security Forces", "legal-key": "", "parts": "", "judge": "High Court in Criminal Appeal Nos. 430, 828 and 429/73.)", "act-used": "", "result": "a sensitive exercise of discretion and not a routine or mechanical prescription acting on hunch. The Trial Court should have collected materials necessary to help award a just punishment in the circumstances. The social background and the personal factors of the crime-doer are very relevant although in practice Criminal Courts have hardly paid attention to the social milieu or the personal circumstances of the offender. Even if S. 360 Cr.P.C. is not attracted, it is the duty of the sentencing Court to be activist enough to collect such facts as have a bearing on punishment with a rehabilitating slant. The absence of suck materials in the present case has left us with little assistance even from the counsel. Indeed members of the bar also do not pay sufficient attention to these legislative provisions which relate to dealing with an offender in such manner that he becomes a non-offender. We emphasise this because the legislations which relate to amelioration in punishment have been regarded as 'Minor Acts' and, therefore, of little consequence. This is a totally wrong approach and even if the Bar does not help, the Bench must fulfil the humanising mission of sentencing implicit in such enactments as the Probation of offenders Act. In the present case, the offender is a young person and his antecedents have no blemish. His life is not unsettled or restless and the report indicates that he is an agriculturist, pursuing a peaceful vocation. His parents are alive and he has a wife and children to maintain. These are stabilizing factors in life. A long period of litigation and the little period of imprisonment suffered? will surely serve as a deterrent. We are mindful of the fact that a fire-arm has been used by the appellant and we cannot sleep over the gravity of the offence. Nevertheless, the report of the Probation officer states that the appellant is not given to any bad habits or stresses of poverty. A land dispute led to the crime and that does not survive any longer. The Probation officer recommends that an opportunity be given to the appellant to improve himself and bring up his family by honest labour as an agriculturist so that the interests of social defence may be secured. We are inclined to agree that in this case the appellant may be given the benefit of the Probation of offenders Act. We are satisfied that the offender has a fixed place of abode and regular occupation. We are inclined also to rely on the Probation officer's report which supports the direction for release on probation. We, therefore, direct that the appellant be released under S. 4(1) of the Probation of offenders Act, 1958, and instead of sentencing him direct that he be released on his entering into a bond before the trial Court with two sureties, one of whom shall be his father, to appear and receive sentence when called upon during the period of. three years from the date of release and in the meantime to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. In addition, we pass an order that the Probation officer shall have supervision A over the offender for a period of one year and shall make reports once every three months to the Sessions Court about the conduct of the offender. We direct further, that the appellant shall be specially supervised from the point of consumption of intoxicants and the matter brought to the notice of the Court in case the appellant violates. The undertaking to be incorporated in his bond shall contain a term that he shall not consume alcohol during the period covered by the bond. We allow the appeals in the manner above indicated.\n"}

Counsel on behalf of the respondents repeated the contention which had been advanced in the High Court that Principals of 4 unaffiliated Colleges attended the Court meeting and therefore the election was bad. The High Court rightly rejected that contention. There is evidence to show that in the month of June, 1969 the Government sanctioned the recommendation of the University for affiliation of these Colleges to the University. The affiliation was for three years from 1969. In these orders it was stated that the final Government notification would be issued after the University submitted a report to the Government of fulfilling the conditions. The respondents' contention was that the notification was published after the month of May, 1970. The High Court rightly held that the sanction was granted by the Government. Delayed publication of the notification would not detract from the sanction ,previously granted. The third contention which had been urged in the High Court was not pressed here. For these reasons, we accept the appeal and set aside the judgment of the High Court. Each party will pay and bear its own costs in this Court.\n"}

Only one category consisting of medicines and substances used or prepared for use exclusively in accordance with the Ayurvedic or Unani system of medicine was taken out of the definition of drug before the amendments made by Act XIII of 1964. That Act, as mentioned before, deleted the exception. In our view medicines or substances have to be taken as a whole and in the present cases it will have to be decided by the trial magistrate whether Bindra's Antiphlogistic Plaster and Bindra's Yabrooj Plaster (Belladona Plaster) are medicines which are exclusively used or which have been prepared for use exclusively in accordance with the Ayurvedic or Unani system of medicine. As regards the adverb \"exclusively\" we concur in the view of the High Court that it must be taken to govern the words \" used\" as well as \"prepared for use\"; but in our opinion each individual ingredient or component of the preparation in question will not be the decisive or determining factor and what the court will have to decide after recording such evidence as may be produced will be whether the aforesaid medicines (they can hardly be called substances) were exclusively used or were prepared for use exclusively in accordance with the Ayurvedic or Unani system. If they fulfill that test they would be excluded from the definition of drug as contained in S. 3(b)(i). With these observations, however, the appeals are dismissed.\n"}

This provision had been substituted by the Act 36 of 1973 and would be applicable in the instant case. The petitioner failed to discharge the burden of proof of trust on him by the aforesaid section. The next question which was canvassed before the High Court was that the quantification of the penalty was very high. The High Court however, noted that the liability was incurred by the petitioner in 1973 and the collector made the order in 1975. Admittedly, for about ten years even after the collector's order imposing the penalty, the amount of penalty had not been paid by the petitioner. The value of the smuggled goods was Rs.87, 455 eve n at that time. On that there is no dispute. The penalty permissible is upto five times the value of the goods. The High Court noted that the benefit derived by the petitioner by nonpayment of the amount of Rs.2, 00, 000 at least for ten years is sufficient indication that the penalty could not be treated as arbitrary. That of course, by itself in our opinion is not always a safe guide. But in the facts and circumstances of this case, the penalty was not heavy and the High Court was right. It is true that this Court in Malhotra's case (supra) had laid down that the penalty could not be arbitrary and excessive. But in the facts of this case, it was not so. As far as the value of the wrist watches is Rs.87, 455 it was not arbitrary because it was not denied even though it was so stated in the show cause notice.In that view of the matter, the High Court was right in not entertaining the petition u/art. 226 of the Constitution. We decline to interfere in this case u/art. 136 of the Constitution. The special leave petition is rejected.\n"}

Mr. Shroff argues that it could not have been the intention of the legislature to have two parallel bodies-the Labour Commissioner as well as the State Industrial Court or a District Industrial Court-having jurisdiction to decide such a matter. For, as he points out, it may well be that while on an application under s. 16(3) the Labour Commissioner holds that the strike was not illegal the contrary view may be taken by the State Industrial Court or the District Industrial Court on an application under s. 41 or vice versa. This argument is plausible at first sight. There is, however, one great difficulty in accepting it. That consists in the fact, already pointed out, that the State Industrial Court or a District Industrial Court is not bound to give any decision at all on application by any party other than the State Government. There being thus cases where the authorities mentioned in s. 41 may refuse to decide the question of legality or illegality of a strike, it is not possible to say that exclusive jurisdiction is given by s. 41 to these authorities to decide the question of legality or illegality of a strike. It is reasonable to held therefore that for performing its functions under s. 16(3) of the Act the Labour Commissioner has jurisdiction to decide the question of legality or illegality of a strike when that question is raised before it.The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No order as to costs.\n"}

In our view the respondent was a foreigner when he entered India in April 1955 as the definition of foreigner then stood, and by overstaying beyond the period permissible under the visa on the strength of which he had entered India he clearly committed breach of cl. 7 of the Foreigners' Order, 1948 and was liable to be punished under s. 14 of the Foreigners Act, 1946. He was, therefore, rightly convicted and sentenced by the Trial Magistrate. The High Court, in our view, erred in setting aside that order of conviction and sentence. The appeal by the State is, therefore, allowed and the order of the Trial Court is restored.\n"}

This is an appeal pursuant to the special leave granted in appeal filed by the State of Orissa against the judgment of the High Court. The matter arises out of arbitration proceedings and the dispute is regarding the interest that was awarded.", "act-used": "", "result": "4. It is thus clear that before the 1978 Interest Act came into force there was no provision under which the interest for the pre-reference period could be granted. In this case, the Supreme Court also held that the interest pendente lite i.e. from the date of reference to the date of the award, the claimants would not be entitled to the same for the reason that arbitrator is not a court within the meaning of S. 34 CPC since the reference was not by a court in a pending suit. This view regarding the interest pendente lite however has been reversed in Secretary, Irrigation Department, Government of Orissa v. G.C Roy ((1992) 1 SCC 508 1991 Indlaw SC 421) Regarding the interest during the pre-reference period, the view taken in Abhaduta Jena case' is not disturbed. Therefore the interest during the pre-reference period can be awarded provided on the date of the award, 1978 Interest Act was in force. In the instant case, we are not specifically concerned with -the interest pendente lite. The submission on behalf of the State with reference to the interest during pre-reference period is that admittedly the proceedings before the arbitrator were initiated in the year 1977 and the award was passed on March 7, 1979 namely before the 1978 Interest Act came into force and therefore the interest during the pre-reference period cannot be awarded. But the difficulty in the instant case is that the interest of Rs 63,186 as shown in the award cannot necessarily be taken as interest for the pre-reference period. It is not clear whether the interest so awarded includes the pendente lite interest and the period also has not been indicated. As a matter of fact, the learned Subordinate Judge who made the award a rule of the court has clearly noted that the plaintiff claimed interest and the learned arbitrator allowed Rs 63,186 without noting the period or the rate of interest. Therefore, it is difficult to infer that the interest awarded includes interest during the pre-reference period as well as the period during which the arbitration proceedings were pending (pendente lite). Therefore the question of remanding it to the arbitrator does not arise. Even otherwise this matter was referred to the arbitrator in respect of an agreement entered into in the year 1971 and we do not think that at this distance of time it is in the interest of justice to set aside the impugned,. judgment and reopen all the proceedings, particularly when there is no clear indication that the impugned award included the interest during the pre reference period. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.\n"}

The facts giving rise to this petition are set out in our judgment of even dated in Civil Appeal No. 1276 of 1975 and need not be re-iterated. In view of the settled position of law that this Court would be reluctant to interfere with or disturb the decision of specially constituted authorities or tribunals under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 especially when the Legislature has entrusted the task of granting or renewing the stage carriage permits to the aforesaid authorities or tribunals which are expected to be fully conversant with the procedure and practice and the relevant matters which should engage their attention under the provisions contained in the Act and nothing basically wrong with the order sought to be appealed against so far as Harish Chandra Mishra is concerned has been found by the High Court, as also the observations made by this Court in Mohd.

K. Mathur, J.", "act-used": "", "result": "45. The petitioner has stated that there will be no chance of fair trial in the State of U.P. as most of the witnesses are afraid to speak against the respondents and even one Shri Rajender Yadav was killed as he deposed against these persons. It was also mentioned that the State Government is not serious. The State Government has already withdrawn the POTA cases against the accused persons and directed the public prosecutor to withdraw these cases. In this background, there is no likelihood of fair trial in the State of U.P. The respondents failed to file counter affidavit, but an affidavit has been filed by one Dinesh Priyadarshi on behalf of respondents No. 2 to 4. But no affidavit was filed by the respondents though they were made a party to the petition. We failed to understand why the affidavit has not been filed by respondents themselves. It is alleged that accused Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja is an independent MLA who is supporting the present government and is a Minister in the government. After going through the transfer petition and counter affidavit on behalf of the respondents, we are of the opinion that there is likelihood of miscarriage of justice in the background mentioned above. It is alleged that murder of Shri Rajender Yadav has taken place and his younger brother is connected with this case. Therefore in the interest of justice both these cases be transferred to any other court where, in a proper atmosphere, the matter can be dealt with fairly. In the interest of justice, we direct that criminal case No.3/2003 in crime case No.10/03 under Sections 3 & 4 of POTA Act titled as State vs Udai Pratap Singh, Raghu Raj Pratap Singh @ Raja Bhaiya and Akshya Pratap Singh @ Gopalji, and case No. 113/2002 & 209/2002 under Section 2/3 of U.P. Ganster & Anti Social Activities(Prevention) Act, 1986 titled as State of U.P. vs. Udai Pratap Singh, Raghu Raj Pratap Singh @ Raja Bhaiya & Akshya Pratap Singh pending in the Court of Special Judge(Gangster Act), Allahabad, U.P. be transferred to a Special Judge in M.P. Let the Hon. Chief Justice nominate any Special Judge to try these cases. The transfer petitions are accordingly allowed.\n"}

It is unnecessary for the purposes of this case to go into the larger question of production of the documents covered by s. 54(1) by third parties as it was the son of Manilal the assessee who had produced the assessment orders which are in dispute. There is an overwhelming weight of authority in favour of the view that assessment orders could be produced by the assessee or his representative-in- interest; see Emperor v. Osman Chotani((1942)101.T.R.429 1942 Indlaw MUM 1), Suraj Narain v. Seth Jhabhu Lal & Others((1945)131.T.R.13) 1944 Indlaw ALL 1 and Buchibai v. Nagpur University((1947)151.T.R.150). 1945 Indlaw MUM 150 In our opinion the law laid down by these cases on the admissibility of evidence of assessment orders produced by an assessee or his representative-in-interest is unexceptionable. We may refer to a decision of this Court in Charu Chandra Kundu v. Gurupada Ghosh ([1962 2 S.C.R. 833) 1961 Indlaw SC 154 on which reliance was placed on behalf of the appellants. There the appellant had applied to the trial court praying that the Commissioner of Income tax be directed to arrange for the production before the court of the record of the statement made by the respondent therein. In that situation it was held that the prohibition imposed under s. 54 of the Act was absolute and the operation of the section was not obliterated by any waiver by the assessee in whose assessment the evidence was tendered, documents produced or record prepared. It is apparent that in that case the question of production of an assessment order by the assessee himself did not come up for consideration. These appeals fail and are dismissed with costs. One hearing fee.\n"}

We must accordingly hold that the order of the High Court, in so far as it declared the rights of the highest bidder, is erroneous. But, in view of the fact, that the lease was only for the period 1961-62 and that would shortly be expiring, there is no need to direct a fresh consideration of the matter by the authorities.

But the entry complained of is not for the year 1356 F but for the year 1358 F, and this entry would not have been of any avail to Adit Pande for the purposes of s. 16 of the Zamindari Abolition Act. In the circumstances of the case it cannot be said that an offence under a. 218 has been committed by the appellant as in our opinion the prosecution has failed to prove the necessary criminal intention. In these circumstances, we would allow the appeal, set aside the order of conviction and acquit the accused. As a consequence the bail bond shall stand cancelled.\n"}

It also has its own cane fields where it cultivates sugarcane which is entirely consumed by its factory.

The High Court has give its opinion on those questions on the basis of facts found by the Tribunal. The Tribunal is the final fact finding authority. The High Court cannot go behind the fats found by the Tribunal. It was for the assessee to raise questions of fact at the time of hearing of the appeal before the Tribunal. At the reference stage, no fresh investigation into facts is permissible. There may be cases where the Court feels that it is unable to answer the question of law referred because findings of fact are incomplete. In such cases, the Court may call for a supplementary statement from the Tribunal. But that is not the case here. The High Court did not feel any difficulty in answering the question on the basis of the facts found. The assessee's prayer is for a direction to the Tribunal to consider new questions of fact which were not raised before the Tribunal at all. We see no reason to grant this prayer at this stage.These appeals must also fail and are dismissed. The Special Leave Petition No. 2611 of 1988 is also dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.\n"}

It may be that the Physical Director gives his guidance or teaching to the students only in the evenings after the regular classes are over. It may also be that he University has not prescribed in writing any theoretical and practical classes for the students so far as physical education is concerned. But as pointed by us earlier, among various duties of the Physical Director, expressly or otherwise, are included the duty to teach the skills of various games as well as their rules and practices. The said duties bring him clearly within the main part of the definition as a `teacher'. We therefore, do not accept the contention raised in the additional counter affidavit of the University.For the aforesaid reasons the appeal is allowed and judgment of High Court is set aside and it is declared that appellant was entitled to continue in service till he completed 60 years of age. Now that he has retired he is entitled to the emoluments payable to him for the remaining period of the service upto the completion of 60 years deducting the period for which he worked as Physical Director beyond 58 years pursuant to stay orders granted by the High Court. His retiral benefits shall also be computed on the basis that his age of retirement was 60 years. The appeal is allowed and disposed of accordingly.\n"}

He is not able to remember clearly the circumstances under which he made the endorsement in Ext. 69 that it was given by Ranjit Meshram. It does not affect his evidence regarding Ext. 70. No mala fides have, been imputed to him and we see no reason why we should not accept his evidence.

Nigam and Others", "cit-id": "1973 Indlaw SC 85", "case-cat": "", "subject": "Labour & Industrial Law", "legal-key": "", "parts": "", "judge": "A. Alagiriswami, J.", "act-used": "", "result": "9. We have already pointed out that the High Court has rightly held that such a provision cannot be said to be irrelevant to the question of promotion from among the Civil Judges to Additional District and Sessions Judges. We are firmly of opinion that in the face of these circumstances to allow the respondent No. 1 to be considered for promotion as Additional District and Sessions Judge in preference to others who had been found better qualified to be posted as Civil Judges Class I much earlier merely on the basis of the date of his entry into service would be a mockery of all canons of fair play and justice. Indeed, we cannot help feeling that his being found fit for promotion to Class I Civil Judge on 30-11-68 seems to have been done more as a matter of grace and he should be more than happy to have got what he got. The fact that before 3-5-66 there might have been cases of Civil Judges being posted as Presiding Judges of Civil Courts Class I clue to various exigencies of service cannot in any case affect the merits of this case. As we have already indicated while it is not impossible it is improbable that compared to those people who had been posted as Class I Civil. Judges before 3-5-66 the respondent No. 1 would have been found better qualified. At any rate we can see no justification for reopening cases that had been closed more than 10 years ago at the instance of an officer whose record of service to say the feast, is not shining one. We see no merits in his claim. We, therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court. There will, however, be no order as to costs.\n"}

In view of the above judgment the necessary conclusion is that the application for reference does not lie. The reference could be made only on the basis of the Judgment of the Reference Court but within the limitation prescribed under the proviso of Sec. 28A(1). In this case neither the application was filed within limitation nor immediately after the award of the District Court. Under these circumstances the Amendment Act 68 of 1984 cannot be applied and the High Court clearly committed error of law is allowing the revision. The appeal is allowed. The order of the High Court in C.R. No. 88/1992 dated August 14, 1992 is set aside but in the circumstances without costs.\n"}

It has been urged for the respondent that if the impugned rule be held to be invalid, old r. 16 gets revived and that the tax assessed on the petitioner will be good. We do not agree. Once the old rule has been substituted by the new rule, it ceases to exist and it does not automatically get revived when the new rule is held to be invalid. Lastly, we may refer to the Preliminary objection raised on behalf of the respondent to the maintainability of this petition, in view of the decision of this Court in Ujjam Bai v. State of Uttar Pradesh 1961 Indlaw SC 465This petition does not come within that decision. This is not a case in which the tax has been levied by the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer by misconstruing certain provisions of a valid Act, but is a case where the taxing officer had no jurisdiction to assess the tax on account of the invalidity of the rule under which the tax was assessed. We therefore allow this petition with costs holding the impugned rule 16 (2) invalid and order the issue of a writ of mandamus to the State of Madras and the Sales Tax Authorities under the Act to refrain from, enforcing any of the provisions of r. 16 (2) and direct them to refund the tax illegally collected from the petitioner.

This is an appeal u/s. 14 of the Terrorists Affected Areas (Special Courts) Act, 1984. The learned Additional Judge, Special Court, Bhatinda by his order and judgment dated 22-4-85 convicted the appellant u/s. 25 of the Arms Act and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of Rs. 100/-, in default of payment of fine, further rigorous imprisonment for fifteen days. The prosecution case in short is that on 31-1-84 the accused was arrested by Assistant Sub-Inspector, Bakhshish Singh and other police officials near the drain bridge in the area of village Seaon  under suspicious circumstances. A personal search was conducted on the body of the accused and 10 kgs. of opium was recovered from a jhola carried by the accused and one country made pistol and two live cartridges of 12 bore were also found in his possession. Such arms were kept without any licence. Two separate cases were registered against the accused, one under the Opium Act and the other under the Arms Act. After obtaining necessary sanction from the Additional District Migistrate, Bhatinda, the accused was prosecuted under the Arms Act before the learned Special Judge and in that proceedings, the aforesaid conviction and sentence were passed. The learned Judge has come to the finding that the prosecution case has been clearly established by the evidence adduced by the police officials and in cross-examination nothing turned out to contradict them. The accused did not make any statement u/s. 313 of Cr.P.C. but he denied his complicity in the offence. It appears that one Rup Singh DW-2 and two doctors namely Dr. Rajinder Kumar Garg DW-1 and Dr. K. C. Goyal DW-3 were examined on behalf of the accused. From the evidence adduced by the doctors it transpires that in the police custody the accused suffered some injuries as noted by the learned Judge. In our view, the learned Judge has rightly indicated that even if the accused was subjected to torture in police custody, a different case might arise for the same against erring police officials. In the facts of the case, we do not find any reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and the appeal, therefore, fails and is dismissed. It, however, appears that the incident had taken place in January, 1984 and by an order passed by this Court on 17-6-85, the appellant was released on bail. Considering the aforesaid fact and also considering the fact that long time has since lapsed, we think that justice will be met if the sentence is reduced to the period of four months. We accordingly reduce the sentence to that extent. This appeal is dismissed with the aforesaid modification of the sentence\n"}

Purity of the judicial stream should not be allowed to be polluted by such a clandestine move and citizens should not be misled by actions of the conspirators. We, therefore, direct that the Central Bureau of Investigation shall step in forthwith and complete the investigation within two months and provide a copy of the report containing the result of the investigation to this Court. A copy of the report shall simultaneously be submitted to the learned Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court. The appeal is allowed with costs. As and when the respondents who are said to be petitioners in writ petition No. 5267 of 1990 are identified shall be made to pay the costs of this appeal which we assess at Rs.10,000. Out of the costs as and when recovered, the appellants shall be entitled to a sum of Rs.3,000 and the remaining sum of Rs.7,000 shall be paid to the Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee.\n"}

After all in so serious a crime as murder, where so severe a sentence as life imprisonment has been inflicted by the trial court and the appeal is as of right, the High Court must indicate in a reasoned judgment that it has applied its mind to the material questions of fact and law. A judgment may be brief but not a blank, especially in a situation such as this. For this reason we should have straightaway set aside the judgment of the High Court and sent it back for fresh hearing, but under Article 136 where justice is the paramount consideration we wanted to reduce the delay in the proceedings since there is a sentence of life imprisonment on the petitioner so we directed that the original record be sent for so that counsel on both sides may have the opportunity to peruse the entire case records and make submissions to us as if we were hearing the appeal in the regular course. Counsel have had that facility and have made submissions after perusal of the materials. After a brief hearing counsel for the petitioner was unable to demonstrate that the trial court's judgment was vitiated by any flaw in appreciation of evidence or assessment of probabilities. We, therefore, dismiss the Special Leave Petition after satisfying ourselves that natural justice has had its full play. Dismissed.\n"}

It is evident, that the facts in this case point out, that the plea for compassionate employment is not to enable the family to tide over the sudden crisis or distress which resulted as early as September, 1972. At the time Ram Singh died on 12.9.1972 there were two major sons and the mother of the children who were apparently capable of meeting the needs in the family and so they did not apply for any job on compassionate grounds. For nearly 20 years, the family has pulled on, apparently without any difficulty. In this background, we are of the view that the Central Administrative Tribunal acted illegally and wholly without jurisdiction in directing the Authorities to consider the case of the respondent for appointment on compassionate grounds and to provide him with an appointment, if he is found suitable. We set aside the order of the Tribunal dated 22.2.1993. The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.\n"}

It was, however, contended that although an appeal filed under s. 420 may have been dismissed summarily a subsequent appeal filed through a pleader ought to have been heard and the Judicial Commissioner erred in holding that the appeal did not lie. The appeal could not have been summarily rejected without the pleader having been heard. From that point of view the provisions of s. 421 had not been complied with. It is sufficient to say that if the order dated October 28, 1955, dismissing the appellant's appeal under s. 420 was lawful, a second appeal from the same judgment of conviction presented through a pleader was not maintainable because the previous order of the High Court dismissing the appeal was final under s. 430 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Certain cases were relied upon to which reference has been made by the Judicial Commissioner. Those cases can be distinguished from the present case. In none of them was it decided that where an order dismissing the appeal is lawful a subsequent appeal filed through a pleader was maintainable. In our opinion, there is no substance in this point, once it is held that the order dated October 28, 1955, was a lawful order which, we think, it was, as in our opinion the proviso to s. 421 in no way offends against the provisions of Art. 14 of the Constitution.\n"}

The process of reasoning adopted by the High Court is absolutely unintelligible to us. It is manifest that whenever the allegations of smuggling are made against a person who is sought to be detained by way of preventing further smuggling, there is bound to be one act or several acts with the common object of smuggling goods which is sought to be prevented by the Act. It would, therefore, not be correct to say that the object of the Act constitutes the ground for detention. If this is so, in no case there could be any other ground for detention, except the one which relates to smuggling. In our opinion, this is neither the object of the Act nor can such an object be spelt out from the language in which Sec. 5A is couched. What the Act provides is that where there are a number of grounds of detention covering various activities of the detenu spreading over a period or periods, each activity is a separate ground by itself and if one of the grounds is irrelevant, vague or unspecific, then that will not vitiate the order of detention. The reason for enacting Sec. 5(A) was the fact that several High Courts took the view that where several grounds are mentioned in an order of detention and one of them is found to be either vague or irrelevant then the entire order is vitiated because it cannot be predicted to what extent the subjective satisfaction of the authority could have been influenced by the vague or irrelevant ground. It was to displace the basis of these decisions that the Parliament enacted Sec. 5(A) in order to make it clear that even if one of the grounds is irrelevant but the other grounds are clear and specific that by itself would not vitiate the order of detention. Mr. G. A. Shah appearing for the detenu frankly conceded that he is not in a position to support the view taken by the Gujarat High Court on the interpretation of Sec. 5(A). He also stated that he does not want to challenge the vires of Sec. 5 (A) of the Act. Mr. Phadke has frankly stated that he only wants the law to be settled in the peculiar circumstances of this case and the order of the High Court quashing the detention need not be disturbed. We, therefore, hold that the view taken by the High Court on interpretation of Sec. 5(A) is legally erroneous and is hereby overruled. With these observations the appeal is disposed of without disturbing the order of the High Court quashing the order of detention.\n"}

B. Majmudar, J.", "act-used": "", "result": "35. So far as Civil Appeal No.8424/95 arising out of S.L.P.(C) No.2407 of 1986 is concerned, though the High Court had dismissed the writ petition on the ground of alternative remedy, in view of our decision on the main controversy and our finding that the provisions of the Regulation would not hit transaction of transfers entered into prior to coming into force of the Regulation this appeal is required to be allowed on merits. In the present case even though the sale was of the land situated in Adilabad District of Telengana region which was forming a part and parcel of the Agency tracts, as the transaction was of 3 June 1951, much prior to the coming into force of the Regulation I of 1959 as amended by Regulation II of 1963 which became effective in Adilabad from 31 December 1963, this transaction was outside the sweep of Section 3(1) of the Regulation. Consequently no useful purpose would be served by relegating the appellant to the remedy of revision before the State authorties when this question is concluded by our present judgment. The appeal is accordingly allowed. The judgments of the Division Bench of the High Court and that of learned Single Judge are set aside. Writ Petition filed by the appellant before the High Court is allowed. The orders of the authorities below against the appellant passed under Section 3(1)(a) read with Section 3(2)(a) of the Regulation will stand quashed and set aside. As these appeals are being disposed of on a question of law and keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the cases, even though the appeals by the authorities are dismissed and the last appeal moved by T. Rajaiah arising out of S.L.P.(C) No.2407 of 1986 is allowed, there will be no order as to costs in all these appeals.\n"}

It is noteworthy that the status, administrative responsibilities and other conditions which go with the office of the Chairman of the Improvement Trust are not the same as those of the members of the Trust or other statutory bodies. The mere fact therefore, that for the purpose of removing the disqualification, the Chairmen of the Improvement Trusts have been put in cl. (ii) as a class separate from that of the members of the Trust and other statutory bodies in cl. (e) of s.2 does not offend the guarantee of equal treatment enshrined in Art. 14 of the  Constitution. It must be remembered that art. 191(1) (a) of the Constitution gives a wide power to the State Legislature to declare by law what ,office or offices of profit held under the Government shall not disqualify the holder thereof from being chosen or for being a member of the State Legislature. Classification of such offices for the purpose of removing the disqualification has thus been left primarily to legislative discretion. It follows that so long as this exceptive power is exercised reasonably and with due restraint and in a manner which does not drain out Art. 191 (1) (a) of its real content or disregard any constitutional guarantee or mandate, the Court will not interfere. Nothing of this kind has been done by the impugned provisions which would justify the invocation of the extraordinary powers of the Court under Article 226 of the Constitution. No other point has been argued before us. In the result the appeals fail and are hereby dismissed with cost shearing fee limited to one set.\n"}

We indicated to the management, through its counsel, that this was pre-eminently a case for desirability of the dismissal being tempered with some solarium to the workman so as to soften the blow. But there are employers and employers and some have their own reasons and difficulties and so nothing came out of the suggestion.

The learned Judge had sentenced each of the respondents to rigorous imprisonment for three years. The judgment of the High Court is already a decade old. (We are beholden that we are not yet faced with cases in their Silver jubilee year). Respondents have been on bail after undergoing a substantial part of the imprisonment. We understand that some of them are not working as Veterinary doctors or Assistants and have settled down as married men with children. Taking these factors into account, we sentence each of the respondents to rigorous imprisonment for the period already undergone by them. We, however, impose upon each one of them a fine of rupees three thousand, which they shall pay within three months from today. Failing such payment, the respondents shall each undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months.\n"}

The appellant-trust had given shop premises No. 1930/1 situated in Mohalla Ghatia Azam Khan, Agra belonging to the appellant to the original respondent on lease at a monthly rent of Rs. 75/sometime in 1954. The terms relating to the tenancy which were agreed upon between the parties were reduced to writing. This document is Ex.12. It is, however, not registered. As the respondent did not pay any rent to the appellant since 1.1.1960 the appellant served a notice to quit dated 27.3.1961 on the respondent and filed a suit for ejectment and recovery of arrears of rent. The suit was decreed by the Trial Court but was dismissed by the appellate court on the ground that the appellant was not a registered body and all the trustees of the trust had not joined in the suit. The appellant-trust thereafter got itself registered on 8.5.1963. The appellant served a notice to quit on the respondent which is dated 30th of May, 1963. The notice period is 30 days. As the respondent failed and neglected to comply with the notice the appellant filed a suit against respondent for ejectment & recovery of arrears of rent and other consequential reliefs. The suit was filed before the Munsif's Court at Agra. The suit was decreed by the trial court. The respondent filed an appeal before the Additional Civil Judge, Agra.", "act-used": "", "result": "Appeal allowed\n"}

Counsel for the Revenue invited our attention to the amendment made in the Act by the Wealth Tax (Amendment) Act, 1964, in the definition of the word \"assets\" in s. 2(e) of the Act. Relying upon the clause added by the Amending Act \"from the date the interest vests in the assessee\" after the expression \"six years\" in cl. 2(e)(v), counsel contended that this was intended to be a parliamentary exposition of the meaning of the original clause. We do not think that any such intention .appears from the terms of that clause. Assuming that the exception m respect of interest in property which is available to an assessee for a period not exceeding six years from the date the interest vests in the assessee is only to. apply after the date of the amendment by the Wealth Tax (Amendment) Act, 1964, that clause has no application and the terms of the section must be interpreted as they stood at the appropriate valuation date which crystallized the charge of wealth-tax for the appropriate assessment year. It is unnecessary to refer to the amendment made by the same Amending Act in the Explanation to s. 4 of the Act. We are of the view that interest in property which is available to the tax-payer for a period not exceeding six years from the valuation date is not an asset within the meaning of s. 2 (e ) and the value thereof cannot be included in the net wealth of the assessee for the financial yea relevant to the valuation date. The appeal therefore fails and is dismissed.\n"}

Applying this test, even if we accept the contention of the appellant that the impugned Act is bad, that would not finally dispose of the suit, as there are other issues, which have to be tried. We are clearly of opinion that the appeal is not competent under Art. 132, and the fact that a certificate has been given does not alter the position. It is said that the certificate is also under Art. 133, but under that article also, an appeal lies Only against judgments, decrees or final orders, and no certificate could be granted in respect of an interlocutory finding. The result is that this appeal must be dismissed, as not maintainable. We should add by way of abundant caution that as we express no opinion on the correctness of the decision under appeal, this order will not preclude the appellant from claiming such rights as he may have, in appropriate proceedings which he may take. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs.\n"}

A. Desai, J.", "act-used": "", "result": "6.  The reference in the case before us was made under s. 10(1) which provides inter alia that where the appropriate government is of opinion that any industrial dispute exists or is apprehended it may at any time by order in writing refer the matter for adjudication as therein mentioned. The power conferred by s. 10(1) on the Government to refer the dispute can be exercised not only where an industrial dispute exists but when it is also apprehended. From the material placed before the Government, Government reaches an administrative decision whether there exists an industrial dispute or an industrial dispute is apprehended and in either event it can exercise its power under s. 10 (1). But in making a reference under s. 10(1) the Government is doing an administrative act and the fact that it has to form an opinion as to the factual existence of an industrial dispute as a preliminary step to the discharge of its function does not make it any the, less administrative in character. The Court cannot therefore, canvass the order of reference closely to see, if there was any material before the Government to support its conclusion, as if it was a judicial or quasi judicial determination. No doubt it will be open to a party seeking to impugn the resulting award to show that what was referred by the Government was not an industrial dispute within the meaning of the Act, and that, therefore, the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make the award. But, if the dispute was an industrial dispute as defined in the Act, its factual existence and expediency of making a reference in the circumstances of a particular case are matters entirely for the Government to decide upon and it will not be competent for the Court to hold the reference bad and quash the proceedings for want of jurisdiction merely because in its opinion there was no material before the Government on, which it could have come to an affirmative conclusion of those matters, (vide Madras State v. C. P. Sarthy, A.I.R. 1953 S.C. 53 1952 Indlaw SC 83. The Tribunal, however, referred to the decision of this Court in Sindhi Resettlement Corporation Ltd. v. Industrial Tribunal, [1968 L.L.J. 843. 797, in which this Court proceeded to ascertain whether there was in existence an industrial dispute at the date of reference, but the question whether in case of an apprehended dispute Government can make reference under S. 10(1) was not examined. But that apart the question whether an industrial dispute exists at the date of reference is a question of fact to be determined on the material placed before the Tribunal with the cautions enunciated in C. P. Sarthy's case 1952 Indlaw SC 83 (Supra). In the case before us, it can be shown from the record accepted by the Tribunal itself that there was in existence a dispute which was legitimately referred by the Government to the Industrial Tribunal for adjudication. Undoubtedly, it is for the Government to be satisfied about existence of the dispute and the Government does appear to be satisfied. However, it would be open to the party impugning the reference that there was no material before the Government, and it would be open to the Tribunal to examine the question, but that does not mean that it can sit in appeal over the decision of the Government and come to a conclusion that there was no material before the Government. In this case the Tribunal completely misdirected itself when it observed that no demand was made by the workman claiming reinstatement after dismissal. When the inquiry was held, it is an admitted position, that the workman appeared and claimed reinstatement. After his dismissal he preferred an appeal to the Appellate forum and contended that the order of dismissal was wrong, unsupported by evidence and in any event he should be reinstated in service. If that was not a demand for reinstatement addressed to employer what else would it convey. That appeal itself is a representation questioning the decision of the Management dismissing the workmen from service and praying for reinstatement. There is further a fact that when the Union approached the Conciliation Officer the Management appeared and contested the claim for reinstatement. There is thus unimpeachable evidence that the concerned workman persistently demanded reinstatement. If in this background the Government came to the conclusion that there exists a dispute concerning workman S. N. Goyal and it was an industrial dispute because there was demand for reinstatement and a reference was made such reference could hardly be rejected on the ground that there was no demand and the industrial dispute did not come into existence. Therefore, the Tribunal was in error in rejecting the reference on the ground that the reference was incompetent. Accordingly this appeal is allowed and the Award of the Tribunal is set aside and the matter is remitted to tribunal for disposal according to law. The respondent shall pay costs of the appellant in this Court. As the reference is very old the Tribunal should dispose it of as expeditiously as possible.\n"}

By the present appeals the appellant, State of U.P., questions the correctness of the judgment dated 27.2.1990 rendered by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, acquitting the respondents herein by allowing the appeals preferred by the respondents and setting aside the convictions recorded against them by the Additional Sessions Judge, Mainpuri. Be fore we take up the arguments of learned counsel for the appellant, it is necessary to set out the prosecution case.", "act-used": "", "result": "8. It is also noticeable that no blood was found at spot B where it is alleged that Kalicharan - the deceased was first fired . Similarly, Bhopal (PW-2) stated that Kalicharan received gun shot in front of Gangaram's house and the deceased after walking 2 or 3 paces he fell down. All these three eye witnesses in their respective testimony stated that kalicharan was firs t fired at on the spot 'B' shown in the map, prepared by the investigating officer which was towards the east side in front of the house of Gangaram. Kalicharan, thus, according to these eye witnesses, thereupon ran towards the place where the accused were present and where he fell down after walking 2/3 paces. The testimony of these eye witnesses are totally different than the story set out in the FIR and the statement of the eye witnesses, as recorded u/s. 161 Cr. P. C. For these reasons, commencement of the occurrence at the point 'B' or firing at Kalicharan for the first time becomes doubtful.The further case, as set out in the FIR is that, on the exhortation Sher Singh, Malkhan Singh, Shri Krishna and Inder Pal who were armed with Kattas and guns, fired at Kalicharan when his wife Laungi Shri also fell upon his body to save him. At this stage, Bhagwan Singh again exhorted and then Netra Pal and Murari fired at Smt. Langshri with katta and gun, w hereas Tika Ram (PW 1) is his testimony stated that on the exhortation of Bhagwan Singh, Sher Singh, Malkhan Singh, Shri Krishna and Indra Pal Kalicharan was fired whereupon Smt. Langshri fell upon Kalicharan's person in order to save him. At that stage Bhagwan Singh again exhorted to kill Smt. Laungshri, as she has become an eye- witness, Murari and Netra Pal and Bhagwan fired at Smt. Laungshri. Curiously enough, Tika Ram (PW 1), in his cross- examination stated that Kalicharan was first fired at by Sri Krishna, Sher Singh Malkhan Singh, Netra Pal and Bheem Sen together at the gate of Ganga Ram. However, this witness also added the name of Bhimsen as well amongst the person who alleged to have fired for the first time at Kalicharan, which was not the case of the prosecution. Similarly, Tika Ram mentioned the names of Netra Pal among those who fired for the first time and also Bhagwan Singh along with Murari and Netra Pal as co-murderers, which was at variance wit h the case in F.I.R. Bhopal (PW 2), in his testimony stated that Murari, Bheem Sen and Netra Pal fired at Smt. Laungshri which is not the case in the FIR. According to Puttu Lal (PW 3), he after having heard the noise, arrived at the place of occurrence . According to him, Sher Singh shot at Kalicharan in his presence. On exhortation of Bhagwan Singh to kill Smt. Laungshri as she has become an eye-witness, Murari, Netra Pal and Bheem Sen fired at Smt. Laungshri, Tika Ram was the real brother of the deceased Kalicharan and Bhopal (PW 2) was an accused in the case of murder of the son of accused Bhawan Singh and if the cause of murder of Smt. Laungshri was her becoming an eye witness, then it that case Tika Ram (PW 1) and Bhopal (PW 2) who were following Kalicharan ought to have been shot at. Thus reasoning for killing Smt. Laungshri renders the testimony of eye- witnesses as unreliable. Further, Tika Ram (PW 1) stated in the FIR that the accused fired at him when he was 7/8 paces behind Kalicharan the deceased. But, curiously enough, he stated that he did not receive any injury as he hid himself into the trench of kachcha road. The place where he alleged to have hid himself from where he witnessed the occurrence was not exhibited in the map. The fact that Kalicharan had not received any injury coupled with other facts as stated above, makes his presence doubtful as an eye witness at the place of occurrence. Putta Lal (PW 3) in his testimony stated that when gun shot was fired, he took his own gun and arrived at near Mathia which is 16 paces towards south east from the point `B' and from there he witnessed the occurrence. This witness stated that he has shown the place of hiding to the Investigating Officer, but such place has not been exhibited in the map. The FIR further discloses that the accused persons dragged the dead bodies of Kalicharan and Smt. Lungshri from the place of occurrence to bitaura of Deojeet and sprinkle d kerosene oil thereon and were going to ignite the fire. This part of the F.I.R. suggests that PWs-1 and 2, after witnessing the sprinkled kerosene oil on the dead bodies, rushed to the police station. Tika Ram (PW 1), in his statement stated that as soon as the accused persons commenced dragging the dead bodies of the deceased persons, he fled away from there. He could not be see sprinkling of kerosene oil and also he did not get the facts ascribed in the FIR. Similarly, PW 2 (Bhopal) stated that he remained in hiding till the time the dead bodies were taken to Pitaura and the accused person were going to ignite the fire having sprinkled kerosene oil on the dead bodies and as soon as the accused persons were about to ignite fire he left for the police station. Here, were find contradiction in testimony of PW 2 and PW 1, Bhopal and Tika Ram - respectively, and such contradiction becomes very relevant when the investigating officer did not record the statement of any of the eye witnesses named in the FIR on the first day although he arrived at the place of occurrence at about 3.30 P.M. Non-recording of such a statement on the day of occurrence despite sufficient opportunity to record it raises doubt about the authentically of the contents of the FIR and also the testimony of the eye witnesses. There are many other vital discrepancies in the testimony of the eye witnesses inasmuch as the testimony of the witnesses are at variance with the case set out in the First Information Report and as such, the High Court was justified in discarding the testimony of the witnesses. The High Court has correctly appreciated the evidence and at no stretch of imagination it can be said that the findings recorded by the High Court are perverse. For these reasons there is no merit in these appeals. The appeals are accordingly dismissed.\n"}

Apart from the above circumstances in the case before us, the Government of Maharashtra had also issued a circular dated 1-3-1989 after the decision in Dr Chakradhar Paswan case 1988 Indlaw SC 883 (supra) to the effect that the principle of reservation would not apply in the case of an isolated post.

But what the Analyst did was only to make an analysis. It is irrelevant to consider whether he should also have carried out a test. Even if he should have and did not, that would not prevent the report of the result of the analysis from being admitted in evidence. That report would nonetheless be conclusive evidence under s. 25 (3) of the Act. Our attention was drawn to the case of Rai Kishan v. The State of Uttar Pradesh 1959 Indlaw ALL 159. There it was observed that when a report did not state the protocols of the test applied, it could not be said to be a report in the prescribed form. It is not clear from the judgment whether the report in that case purported to be the report of a test or of an analysis. If that case intended to hold that no report of an analysis is in the prescribed form where the protocols are not stated, we are unable to agree with it.

A reading of these rules vis-a-vis the memo of the Governor relied on by the respondents and accepted by the High Court, would clearly show that the Government employees who are in Group 'C' service prior to the introduction of the West Bengal Revision of Pay and Allowances Rule, 1981 alone are entitled to the benefit of being retained in service upto the age of 60 years, reason is obvious. Rules 50 and 75 clearly enumerates that the Government servants in Group 'A' to 'C' shall be required to \"compulsorily retire on attaining the age of 58 years on the last day of the month in which they attained the age of 58 years.\" As seen in the year 1971 the respondents were in the scale of pay above Rs. 230. Consequently they opted to be in Group 'C employees in 1971. When they ceased to be in Group 'D' Government employees and entered into Group 'C' service in 1971 then they continued to remain in Group 'C service for the purpose of compulsory retirement. They cannot fall back upon the Note 2 or the Governor's memo in that behalf since as in 1981 they were no longer in Group 'D' service so as to entitle them to remain in service till they attained the age of 60 years. It is also further to be noted that the benefit given only to the employees who are continuing in Group 'D' employees on the day 1981 revised pay scales Rules had come into force. Such employees in Group 'D' but did not cross over by promotion to Group 'C' service, though were drawing higher scale of pay are entitled to the benefit of 60 years rule........The respondents do not belong to that limited class. Therefore, they are not entitled for the benefit of 1981 Rules or the Amendment Rules or the Governor's Memo. The High Court did not advent to these rules but only to the Governor's 1971 or 1981 memo. The appeals are accordingly allowed. It is now stated that the respondents retired from service. There-fore, their pension shall be computed on the basis of the pay they have last drawn on attaining the age of 58 years and the computation and payment shall be made within a period of 3 months from the date of receipt of this order. The pensionary benefit shall accordingly be released to them within the aforesaid period. The appeal is accordingly allowed with the above directions without costs. It is clarified that if the respondents really had worked till the attained the age of 60 years, it is needless to mention that the Government may not recover the pay already paid except any lawful deductions like lands etc.\n"}

Section 6(2) of the Central Act lays down that where a sale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce of goods of the description referred to in section 8(3) of the Central Act has occasioned the movement of goods from one State to another or has been effected by a transfer of documents of title to such goods during their movement from one State to another, any subsequent sale to a registered dealer during such movement effected by a transfer of documents of title to such goods shall not be subject to tax under the Act. A dealer claiming exemption for subsequent sale during the movement of goods from one State to another is required by section 6(2) of the Central Act to furnish to the prescribed authority in the prescribed manner a certificate duly filled and signed by the registered dealer by whom the goods were purchased containing the particulars. In the present case, the appellant would be entitled to exemption in production of appropriate form by the Bombay seller and by showing that the buyer is a registered dealer. The appellant produced the form from Bombay seller but did not prove that his buyer was a registered dealer in cotton. Therefore, the Tribunal rightly held that the appellant was not entitled to exemption under section 6(2) of the Act. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs.\n"}

The short question which arises in these two appeals is in regard to the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain the suit challenging the imposition of penalty of withholding of certain increments on the delinquent having been found guilty of misconduct under the relevant Civil Services (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1952. The trial court dismissed the suit holding that it had no jurisdiction since according to it the case was covered by S. 2(a) of the Industrial Disputes Act read with Item No. 1 of Schedule III thereof. In appeal the learned Additional District Judge, Rohtak reversed this order of the trial court holding that the delinquent-plaintiffs had not contended breach of any standing orders but had merely contended that the impugned orders were governed under the 1952 Rules referred to earlier and, therefore, the right or liability arose under common law and hence attracted Principle No. 2 laid down in the judgment of this Court in Premier Automobiles Ltd. v. Kamlakar Shantaram Wadke . The High Court refused to interfere with the view taken by the appellate court. The averments in the plaint would primarily govern the question of jurisdiction. Although the plaint is not before us it is clear from paragraphs 6 and 7 of the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge, Rohtak that the delinquent-plaintiffs had not challenged the orders on the ground that they violated any standing orders but had based the challenge in common law contending that their case was governed under the Civil Services (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1952. The learned Additional District Judge has, therefore, recorded a finding that the case set out in the plaint was not based on S. 2(a) of the Industrial Disputes Act or on the language of the standing orders but was essentially based on the provisions contained in the 1952 Rules and, therefore, the rights and liabilities arose under common law and would attract Principle No. 2 of the Premier Automobiles  judgment. In the absence of anything to show to the contrary we think that the High Court was right in not interfering with the order passed by the lower appellate court and we too do not see any reason to do so in exercise of our extraordinary power u/art. 136 of the Constitution. In the result, both the appeals fail and are dismissed with no order as to costs\n"}
